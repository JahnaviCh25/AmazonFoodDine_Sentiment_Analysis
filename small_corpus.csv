I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

On Friday morning, February 25, 2011, I was awakened by the screams of my fianc&eacute;e Lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling Greta, our 2 ½ year-old registered female Pug.  Greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a Purina Busy Bone.<br /><br />I'm left wondering how Purina, a company with a name as iconic as Betty Crocker, Bayer, Gerber and General Mills, could have not only manufactured such a lethal product, but, as I've since discovered on the Internet, has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time - and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves.  I find this absolutely appalling.  I'm 57 years-old and I've put my trust in Purina products since I was a child.  And now our beloved Greta, purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of 2008, is dead because of your product.  And Lori, my sweetheart of 32 years, a stroke victim in 2004 and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe; a great animal lover, has had her heart torn asunder.  She's simply devastated - and angry.  And so am I.<br /> Did you know that in the United States its citizens spend more on their pets than their children?  Are you familiar with the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show series which includes the world's finest breeds in competition for ""Best in Show,"" including the Chinese Pug?  Do you have any idea of the loss we've suffered at your negligent hands?<br /> I could talk about the money we paid for Greta from the breeder, and having her spayed (we don't breed our beloved pets; we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can).  And there are the regular check-ups, and shots and so on.  I find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the Kroger store from which we purchased your killing Busy Bone.<br /> I have a 91 year-old father who lives alone.  I visit him at least twice a week, sometimes more if time allows.  He certainly appreciates those visits.  But he also has a fulltime companion - Spencer, his Jack Russell terrier.  Spencer will turn 12 in May.  Dad is disabled, uses a walker, is scheduled for heart-valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, and has a myriad of other health issues.  Yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog.  And I believe if it weren't for the loving attention Spencer gives dad, he would not be alive today.  His dog has given him something special - the gift of life.  Something which Purina has stolen away from us.  You'd think that Purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year-old man.  But tragically that's not the case.<br /> Yet there's more.  We also have a male pug which we named Winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of Winston Churchill.  Winston, like Greta was, is truly an individual - a soulful companion.  And like us, he's now subdued.  He's actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesn't understand why.  This concerns me.<br /> I am a professional photographer and writer by trade.  I work with the general public and I have to present a side to it which instills confidence.  Writing, by nature, requires a certain state of mind as well.  As a result of losing Greta, all I can think about now is me handing her a Busy Bone, not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later.  The guilt is killing me.  How can I write?  How can I do anything?  Grief passes they say.  But tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime.  And what makes things worse in this case is that Greta's death could have been prevented.<br /> Though both Winston and Greta liked the Busy Bone, several times in the past Greta had gagged on it.  So, I served her a smaller portion each time, which, after careful observation I assumed resolved the problem.  In retrospect I should have responded more to the concerns Lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with.  In a brief moment, while we were in another room, Greta died because of your product.  And why should such a product even exist?  Why wasn't it at least labeled as a choking hazard?  Why didn't Purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores?<br /> The answer is self-evident: Gross negligence.  A negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved Greta and other dogs, but has now indelibly left its mark in Lori's and my life.  We'll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor.  I lie awake at night thinking about it now, as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even I, a writer, cannot express in words.  It's now the closest we can get to our special friend.  We are utterly distraught.  Greta, only 2 ½ years-old, healthy and in her prime, a wonderful, loving companion, is gone forever.  It's a horrid loss that cannot be replaced - thanks to Purina.<br /> The very least Purina can do is pull all forms of the Busy Bone from the market immediately, and to conduct adequate, responsible research in the future before releasing any Purina product.<br /><br /> Karl and Lori<br /> Former owners of beloved Greta, purebred female pug.  Our baby.  Gone forever."

429239,B003MWBFMK,A14VQRIH3FDX5K,kittenkatt,5,6,1,1309910400,"Sickening filler ingredients, high price","I think the ingredients in this food speak for themselves - cheap filler & byproducts supplemented with vitamins.  After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.  I am also disgusted that so many veterinarians have apparently been bought off by the Hill's company.<br /><br />This Science Diet formula's first 8 ingredients:<br />1 - Brewers rice: Filler. Processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice. (Cat's don't need grain, and this is the first ingredient!)<br />2 - Chicken By Product Meal: Parts of chicken not fit for human consumption, i.e. head, feet, bones, entrails, blood, intestines, etc.<br />3 - Corn Gluten Meal: Corn byproduct used as an inexpensive protein source.  Many cats and dogs are allergic to corn and, again, cats are carnivores and do not need grain.<br />4 - Powdered Cellulose:  Sawdust!<br />5 - Ground Whole Grain Corn:  More cheap, HYPER allergenic grain that cats don't need.<br />6 - Chicken Liver Flavor:  Self explanatory, but why not just use real chicken liver?<br />7 - Animal Fat: Fat from an unnamed animal source, most likely fat from many types of animals that the Hills company would rather not name.<br />8 - Soybean Mill Run: Soybean hulls - a cheap, byproduct filler.  Soy is also highly allergenic.<br /><br />The funny thing - anyone who buys Science Diet knows it's pretty expensive food.  Yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren't that expensive to source.  What's worse is that this food can cause serious health problems like diabetes due to the ridiculously high amount of carbohydrates (aka sugars).  The guaranteed analysis on the Hill's website indicates this food is composed of 43.2% carbohydrates.  That's completely inappropriate for the nutritional needs of cats.<br /><br />I was lucky to ""see the light"" before my cat developed any serious health problems from this food.  My cats symptoms on Science Diet were fairly mild, but still concerning - she got fatter and fatter, she was inactive, her coat was dull, and she pooped a lot.  The first food I switched her to was Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Formula, which is a grain-free, high protein diet that costs about half the price of Science Diet.  The first 8 ingredients of Taste of the Wild are chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat, pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon.  Obvious improvement over Science Diet's ingredients.  My cat loved it, started losing weight, more activity, coat became shiner, and there were litter box benefits as well (less poo because she was no longer eating filler that her body couldn't process).  I absolutely feel Taste of the Wild is an amazing value for grain-free cat food and a vastly superior product compared to Science Diet and most other commercial cat foods.<br /><br />A few months ago I found Orijen cat food and decided to switch again.  The first 8 ingredients of Orijen are fresh boneless chicken, chicken meal, fresh boneless salmon, turkey meal, fresh chicken liver, herring meal, russet potato, chicken fat.  Now doesn't the Orijen ingredient list make the Science Diet ingredients above even more laughable and sad?  After feeding Orijen and a bit of high-quality canned food every day (Tiki Cat or Nature's Variety Instict), my 4 year old cat has practically become a kitten again.  She plays every day and is the picture of lean, bright-eyed, happy feline health.  Changing my cat's diet from Science Diet to a diet appropriate for felines has completely transformed my cat in less than 6 months!<br /><br />There is so much information about feline health out there and so many holistic foods to choose from now.  I strongly believe that anyone who currently feeds Science Diet would feel immediately compelled to switch foods after doing 20-30 minutes of research.  Please do."

By adding soy lecithin to the recipe, they are now producing a bar that is not only tasteless but has a waxy texture that I find disgusting.

Apparently, this has happened only since Lindt started producing the bar in the U.S. and the original formula is still in use in France and Canada but they will not ship it to the U.S. I am extremely disappointed in Lindt for this change and will never buy this product again, unless they go back to the original recipe.

My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old.

My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

I love the taste with a bit of cream and some sweetener. I love it and I drink a lot of it. I've tasted everything from high dollar gourmet blends to cheap supermarket standards just to see which I prefer the most. I'm sometimes as finicky about my coffee as a wine connoisseur is about a robust pinot noir.<br /><br />That's why, when I brewed a pot of this Puroast Low Acid Coffee and tested it, I had to get a second opinion. I hated it. It was horrible on every level. The scent of the grounds as I was preparing the pot was my first clue: not only did they not smell like any coffee I've ever smelled, but the scent was almost a burned rubber odor that, when brewing, permeated the house like day old stink.<br /><br />And then there was the taste.<br /><br />I can't speak to whether or not it does what it's purported to do - ease the sensitive stomachs of those for whom normal coffee is too acidic (which occasionally includes me, especially when I drink a cup at night). I can't speak on that because there was no way, after four or five mouthfuls, I was going to force myself to drink any more to find out. Call me crazy, but I sort of expected the coffee, low acid French Roast or not, to taste like coffee. Not like soaked sweat socks poured over radial tires. It may very well be low acid, but the aftertaste alone makes heartburn preferable.<br /><br />But I know that I'm finicky about coffee, so before I became too hasty in my rush to judgement, I secured a second opinion from my father. My father who loves coffee even more than I, but unlike myself, has never met a cup he couldn't drink, and thinks that drinking the two day old swill at the bottom of a scorched pot is better than wasting it to brew fresh. He drinks it black, likes it strong, and has been known to tolerate even my aunt's coffee...and that, for anyone who's tried it, is saying something.<br /><br />So when he poured himself a cup of this Puroast Low Acid Coffee and settled in his chair, I watched him for his reaction, expecting him to razz me for my persnickety tastes. He drank half a cup, got up, and poured the rest of the cup and the whole of the remaining pot down the drain.<br /><br />That pretty much says it all."

They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor.

Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors.

Ultra filtering is a high-tech procedure where honey is heated, sometimes watered down and then forced at high pressure through extremely small filters to remove pollen, which is the only foolproof sign identifying the source of the honey. It is a spin-off of a technique refined by the Chinese, who have illegally dumped tons of their honey - some containing illegal antibiotics - on the U.S. market for years.<br /><br />Amazing what corporations do for profit. Pollen is what I consume honey for. Pollen is what helps my body as a medicine, a super food, antioxidants, etc. for my health. Without pollen, I might as well consume sugar. Fancy Grade A, Natural, Pure and even Raw are very misused words. These words are used to fool consumers just like it is done in every sector of the food industry. Conventional honey simply does not even come close to organic since it has many unwanted ingredients like GM plants, pesticides, etc. which harm the environment, the honey bee and my health. I consume Manuka as well as certified 100% organic raw honey from reputable source. That way I get the pollens and the antioxidants in the honey like I am suppose to.

My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) Water sufficient for processing, fish, poultry, meat by-products, wheat gluten. How disgusting is that?! ""Fish"" and ""poultry""?? Not really sure how that can be counted as an ingredient...not ""tuna"" or ""salmon"" but ""fish."" Not ""chicken"" or ""turkey"" but ""poultry."" If it was a decent quality meat- they wouldn't feel the need to hide behind ambiguous terms. Then there's the by-product which is the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, pure, meat, and there just isn't real identifiable meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, dry foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or ambiguous ""meats""."

445222,B009GHI5Q4,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,6,14,1,1291420800,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

Well I loves me some peanut butter, but with my new healthy way of eating, it's pretty much absent from my diet these days, even as a very rare treat. With that in mind, I figured what the heck, I'll give this a shot. Boy should I have heeded all the other posters advice! I'm pretty open minded about alternative or food substitutes, but this stuff, well ""YUCK"" is the word!<br />When I got it, along with several other Walden products I ordered from their site, it was the first thing I wanted to try. When I opened the jar it did have the look of PB so I was hopeful, maybe this WOULD be okay. It wasn't. The first taste was sickeningly sweet, almost didn't go back for a second one, but had to to see if what I tasted was right. Next bite was like an entirely different product. This time there wasn't a super sweet taste, more like metallic or something. After that I thought ""oh boy"" I think I just blew nearly $50 bucks on this stuff (all the Walden products I had ordered). In fairness I did try pairing it up with other things, since I'd read on here that others advise not eating it on it's own. So at first I tried a PB&J. It was just as bad. I tried with fruit. I tried mixing it with PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter and Powdered Cocoa Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 6.5 Oz Each - 2 Pack as someone else here suggested (which btw is a peanut butter replacement I do highly recommend). I tried it after I chilled it in the fridge and heated up in the microwave. I kept waiting for any semblance of a peanut flavor, but it never came. And so rather than leave it sitting in my fridge for the next several months, which it would have been as it was never going to get used, I threw it away. It wasn't easy, firstly there was all the money I spent because I not only threw out the Peanut spread, I also tossed the grape and raspberry jams I couldn't stand either. But it was also that I WANTED to have liked this enough to eat it.<br /><br />I will say out of the products I've sampled so far from Walden, I have yet to try the mayo, ketchup, and bacon ranch dressings I bought, I found at least some of them were okay. I'd say the best so far is the chocolate dip. It's nothing like the consistency of melted chocolate, more like a chocolate pudding. But at least it was edible. The French onion dip wasn't too bad either. Thousand Island dressing wasn't all that great, but I'll at least finish the bottle. I also don't really care for the caramel sauce which I did have higher hopes for after the reviews it got.<br /><br />Again, I spent quite a bit on this, and it was pretty much money wasted, as I didn't discover a great new product and won't be buying any of this stuff again. But it hasn't soured me on still trying low calorie alternatives to broaden my diet. I just will probably steer clear of the fake foods, since with tastes like this, the best way to have zero calories in your foods, is to just not have them."

After properly aligning the belt I put it all back together and the unit now blends like it is supposed to.  My guess is that this is the same problem that caused others' blender function to not work.  I would futher venture that the Brezza knows about this issue and has done nothing to correct it.  It's hard to believe that after multiple complaints about the same problem that Brezza does not put its units through some sort of inspection process to prevent this from happening.

In addition, under the fruit snacks box was a crumpled packing slip, which included a coupon for 5% off my next purchase from this company.  It's too bad the coupon expired 3 days before I even received the fruit snacks box, since the coupon was printed three weeks prior, when I actually ordered the thing.<br /><br />Tl;dr DO NOT purchase stuff from this company.  It is worth the extra time needed to find another supplier or buying it from the store.  I paid more for this product than it's price at costco citing convenience due to not having to leave my home, and ended up experiencing the worst online purchase in my 10 years of purchasing history."
55853,B001HTJ2JI,A2A1XYSB692L6J,"Patricia ""A Reader""",5,16,1,1282953600,$ 1 4 . 0 0 .....A.....G A L L O N....?,"WITH SHIPPING, (AND HANDLING!), THE COST OF THIS ARROWHEAD DISTILLED WATER COMES TO $14.005 PER GALLON!  This price is even hard for luxury-loving me to swallow!  Especially as there is a way to make distilled water, (even without a water-distiller!) for just about no cost at all!<br /><br />Please note that I am NOT here singling out Arrowhead Distilled water as being over-priced.  It just happened to come up first on the list of ready-made distilled water, here at Amazon.  I'm sure that it, (and all the other ready-made distilled waters being sold), is tasty and healthy, (and convenient!) distilled water.  However, it is WOEFULLY OVER-PRICED.  My review here is for ALL ready-to-drink, distilled waters, offered on Amazon, (and elsewhere), at such ridiculous prices.<br /><br />HOW can one make distilled water far more cheaply -- and without a<br />water-distiller?  By employing a method known as ""home-distillation"".<br />(This has NOTHING whatsoever to do with home distillation of whisky, of course.  It is for home-distillation of WATER.  Nothing illegal here, (yet, anyway!)  Copper kettles, copper coils, and new-made cornmash are NOT required, or used here!<br /><br />What IS used?  Large, (gallon size, if possible), glass jars.  The type in which organic apple juice often is seen.  What to do:  After washing out the bottle thoroughly, (and or, after previously drinking up all of the delicious organic apple juice), rinse jar throughly, to be sure no soap is left in the jar.  Rinse first with hot water, then, very slowly, (so as not to have an abrupt temperature change that can crack the glass), decrease the amount of hot water, and increase the amount of cold water used to rinse out the jar.  When 100% cold water is flowing from the faucet into the jar, keep rinsing<br />jar for another minute.  Finally, empty the jar, and fill with 100% cold(est) water.  Lightly cover with a PLASTIC cap, as metal caps tend to get rusty after a while.  (I find that different top colours from gallon-sized jugs of milk are perfect for this: gradually build up a collection of red, orange, green, white, and other colour milk-gallon tops, from whole, nonfat, and other types of milk.  Caps from bottles of products such as ENSURE, and PEDIA-SURE, are also good for<br />lightly covering these gallon milk containers, filled now as they are with home-distilled-water-in-the-making.)<br /><br />Fill up as many of these empty gallon glass containers as you can, (and for which you have room on your kitchen counter, or elsewhere), waiting at least an hour before you fill each jug in sequence, using a different colour top for each one.<br /><br />Get some magnets, and place them in a handy place -- like on your refrigerator door.  Take some small pieces of paper, and write the colour of each top/cover, on them.  Attach the pieces of paper to your refrigerator door, (or other handy place).  Line the pieces of paper up in a row, with the colour of the cover of the first jug you fill first, the colour of the colour of the top of the second jug you fill second, and so on.<br /><br />Now, just wait at least 10 hours from the time you fill the first jug.  When you want some distilled water, simply pour it into the saucepan / goldfish bowl, or wherever else you want to use your home-distilled water.  DO NOT USE MORE THAN HALF OF THE CONTENTS OF EACH JAR!  The secret of home-distilled water, you see, is that all of the flouride, and other things that are put into tap water, that you do not want, (and are the reason you buy or make distilled water in the first place), will, during the 10 or more hours you are waiting, sink down to the bottom of the bottle, as they are heavier than the water!<br />I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT YOU BOIL THE WATER IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU HAVE DISTILLED IT, HOWEVER -- AT LEAST TWO FULL MINUTES ON A FULL BOIL.  BECAUSE ""STANDING WATER"" CAN GET STALE, (AND PROBABLY DANGEROUS), IF YOU LEAVE IT OUT TOO LONG WITHOUT REFRIGERATION.)  Of course, if you have a HUGE refrigerator, you can probably put the distilled water into it immediately after filling the jugs, and reduce, or eliminate, the boiling time otherwise required.  If you must boil the water, and want COOL distilled water, just turn the gas or electric stove off after the required two minutes, and wait until the water has cooled.<br /><br />When you finish using the first bottle of distilled water, rinse it out again with hot, then ever-so-slowly, cooler -- then cold water.<br />Move the paper attached to the refrigerator with the magnet, signifying the first bottle, (say, with the word ""blue"" on the paper -- signifying that the first bottle has a blue cap on it), to the end of the row.  Now, take the paper attached by a magnet signifying the second bottle, (say, with the word ""yellow"" written on it, meaning the yellow-capped bottle), to the ""head of the line"" of pieces of paper attached by magnets, on your refrigerator.  And so on.  This way, you need only move the papers attached by magnets, on your refrigerator, and not the bottles themselves, to always know which bottle has been sitting out the longest, (and hence has the most distillation at the moment.)  Lifting these little papers-attached-by-magnets-to-the-refrigerator, and moving them around, to different places in the line on your refrigerator, is a whole lot easier than always lifting, and repositioning the gallon-size glass jars on your kitchen counter!<br /><br />In any event, you will now have pure, home-distilled water!  The longer you let the water remain in the jugs, the more distilled the water will be.  The less you take out of each jug, the more distilled the water will be.<br /><br />NOTE: DISTILLING WATER, BY ANY METHOD, WILL ALSO ELIMINATE NEEDED MINERALS FROM THE WATER.  Because minerals -- along with flouride and other contaminates your well-meaning city water system puts into city water -- are also heavier than the water.  SO, IF YOU DRINK DISTILLED WATER, FROM ANY SOURCE, BE SURE TO ALSO TAKE MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS!<br /><br />This SOUNDS like a very, very complicated process -- but read it a few times, and you will see how actually very, very simple it is.  You get another bonus when boiling the distilled water -- it takes LESS TIME TO BOIL, AND WILL BOIL MORE THROUGHLY, because the floride, minerals, and other things have been removed from the water.  It's like the difference between boiling water that has pebbles in it, and water that doesn't have pebbles in it.  Because these ""extra-aqualar"" particles -- minerals, flouride, etc. -- are just that: tiny, microscopic ""pebbles"".<br /><br />Line up as many gallon jugs as you can find and have room for, (I have 8).  Have fun and save money with your home-distilled water.  It will cost ONLY the price of your water-bill!"

This rice was significantly inferior to several brands of other California grown sticky rice, as well actual sticky rice from Japan.  Rice came out more mushy than other brands - almost like it was overcooked, and on several occasions I would find a few hard pieces of rice mixed in with the rest.  It's passable, but definitely not preferred, especially if you are trying to make sushi or something else where rice texture is important. At the time of this review the price is $14.95 for a 5 lb bag, compared to $7.20 for the same bag at my local Japanese supermarket - the review grade does not reflect this price differential, recognizing that it could change.  I should point out however, that at $15 for a 5 lb bag, you can buy premium sticky rice imported from Japan in a decent Japanese supermarket.<br /><br />Update: Have added additional brands to my comparison list, this one really is on the bottom by far, I question whether the 5 star reviewers have tried any other options (just about any California short grain variety, Botan Calrose from the supermarket, Nishiki - all significantly better than this.)"

After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.  I am also disgusted that so many veterinarians have apparently been bought off by the Hill's company.<br /><br />This Science Diet formula's first 8 ingredients:<br />1 - Brewers rice: Filler. Processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice. (Cat's don't need grain, and this is the first ingredient!)<br />2 - Chicken By Product Meal: Parts of chicken not fit for human consumption, i.e. head, feet, bones, entrails, blood, intestines, etc.<br />3 - Corn Gluten Meal: Corn byproduct used as an inexpensive protein source.  Many cats and dogs are allergic to corn and, again, cats are carnivores and do not need grain.<br />4 - Powdered Cellulose:  Sawdust!<br />5 - Ground Whole Grain Corn:  More cheap, HYPER allergenic grain that cats don't need.<br />6 - Chicken Liver Flavor:  Self explanatory, but why not just use real chicken liver?<br />7 - Animal Fat: Fat from an unnamed animal source, most likely fat from many types of animals that the Hills company would rather not name.<br />8 - Soybean Mill Run: Soybean hulls - a cheap, byproduct filler.  Soy is also highly allergenic.<br /><br />The funny thing - anyone who buys Science Diet knows it's pretty expensive food.  Yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren't that expensive to source.  What's worse is that this food can cause serious health problems like diabetes due to the ridiculously high amount of carbohydrates (aka sugars).  The guaranteed analysis on the Hill's website indicates this food is composed of 43.2% carbohydrates.  That's completely inappropriate for the nutritional needs of cats.<br /><br />I was lucky to ""see the light"" before my cat developed any serious health problems from this food.  My cats symptoms on Science Diet were fairly mild, but still concerning - she got fatter and fatter, she was inactive, her coat was dull, and she pooped a lot.  The first food I switched her to was Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Formula, which is a grain-free, high protein diet that costs about half the price of Science Diet.  The first 8 ingredients of Taste of the Wild are chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat, pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon.  Obvious improvement over Science Diet's ingredients.  My cat loved it, started losing weight, more activity, coat became shiner, and there were litter box benefits as well (less poo because she was no longer eating filler that her body couldn't process).  I absolutely feel Taste of the Wild is an amazing value for grain-free cat food and a vastly superior product compared to Science Diet and most other commercial cat foods.<br /><br />A few months ago I found Orijen cat food and decided to switch again.  The first 8 ingredients of Orijen are fresh boneless chicken, chicken meal, fresh boneless salmon, turkey meal, fresh chicken liver, herring meal, russet potato, chicken fat.  Now doesn't the Orijen ingredient list make the Science Diet ingredients above even more laughable and sad?  After feeding Orijen and a bit of high-quality canned food every day (Tiki Cat or Nature's Variety Instict), my 4 year old cat has practically become a kitten again.  She plays every day and is the picture of lean, bright-eyed, happy feline health.

My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business.

I kept trying to like it, trying it at different temperatures - super chilled, room temp, mildly chilled but still it tasted like nothing. THEN, I read the label - MADE FROM CONCENTRATE! This makes a BIG difference! The flatness of the taste now totally makes sense! I would not recommend this product at all. Seeing all the wildly differing opinions I think either it's a very personal thing or the manufacturers are writing their own reviews:) but so far I've quite like vita coco and Amy and Brian's. Vita Coco to me tastes very genuine but is a little less sweet than Amy and Brian. Amy and Brian's is delicious, it's incredibly sweet despite having no added sugar. Mind you none of these are actually low cal - they still have a good amount of natural sugar. But coming back to Zico, I think of all the natural coconut waters I've had, this is the worst."

Anyone with any concern about their cholesterol or saturated fat content really needs to look closely at the nutritional guide. I couldn't find it listed on their website so I asked them to email me a copy. Wow, 40g of saturated fats in one of these packets and they call it 5 servings. Daily limit of saturated fats for a 2,000 calorie/day person is 16. You would have to eat 4 big macs to match the saturated content of this popcorn. The biggest concern I have with this is the company told me it has no plans to even offer a healthful alternative for pre-packaged packets like this. The problem is entirely with the oil they are using. Coconut oil. They list on their packet no cholesterol and no trans fats, but there's conveniently no mention of the overwhelming amount of saturated fats due to the coconut oil. Most movie theaters have finally changed from coconut oil to canola or other good oils to address this major health concern and bad press over the years. I asked Great Northern to please follow suit, not even asking them to replace this oil with the good oils but to just offer an alternative. They refused. It tastes just as good to me at the movie theaters. In some cases the saturated fats have been reduced 15 times with the change from coconut to good oils. I love popcorn. But health is a concern to me. If you are concerned about saturated fats, look at the nutritional guide for these packets."

The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats."

If your answer is ""Yes"", then do not, for any reason, be persuaded to purchase any single cup brewing system nor any brand of pre-packaged coffees, teas, etc. If you enjoy the taste of instant coffee, then you might be satisfied with the mediocre results obtained from these unbelievably popular and overpriced brewing systems.<br /><br />I have tried them all: Keurig, Tassimo, Illy, along with pre-packaged coffees from Timothy's, Green Mountain, Tully's, etc. I have even used my own freshly ground high-grade coffees in these machines. The results are always the same: insipid, dull drinks. How these systems continue to sell is a mystery to me. All the ""high-tech"" design that goes into making these systems easy to use and convenient cannot overcome their one common fatal flaw - they all rely on vacuum-packed coffee which has lost all of it's aromatic oils and is essentially stale when it is brewed. And the brief time that these machines allow heated water to contact the coffee simply does not constitute ""brewing"".<br /><br />Einstein once said, ""Perfection of means and confusion of ends characterize this age."" He could have been talking about these brewing systems. They're great in concept, and well-designed and fabricated... But they can't produce a decent cup of coffee. Isn't that the point? (It reminds one of the futility of creating life-like stereo sound equipment, so that people can play ""Rap"" on it.)<br /><br />If you really love good coffee, forget the convenience temptation of these systems, and brew your cup the old-fashioned way. You'll save money, and you won't regret having wasted it on something that will wind up in your next garage sale."

After drinking two or three cups of coffee with either the regular Vanilla or the Sugar Free Chocolate, I can tell you that the regular Vanilla is okay but nothing to get excited about, and the Sugar Free Chocolate leaves everything to be desired.  After trying two flavours, I certainly would not rush to send emails to friends and family to tell them of a great find for their coffee.<br /><br />The sugar free leaves behind a very, very unpleasant aftertaste in my opinion, even though I am used to diet soda, etc. The aftertaste is so strong and so unpleasant that the only way I am able to get rid of the aftertaste is to brush my teeth!  Something that is delicious does not make you want to brush your teeth after drinking it.  The regular Vanilla was better than the Sugar Free Chocolate, but of course, it has a whopping 20 sugars per serving, which is more than a can of regular soda. Twenty sugars is a very high sugar count, and it is very fattening, so the sugared varieties are not something one would want to use regularly unless one was intentionally trying to put on weight.<br /><br />Also, I have noticed that these syrups tend NOT to remain well mixed in my coffee despite the fact that I stir well.  I plan to offer the bottle of Sugar Free Chocolate to a friend (albeit with a warning) because the aftertaste is just too unpleasant for me.  The Sugar Free Chocolate should be called Bitter Chocolate in my opinion.  I even added real sugar to my coffee with the Sugar Free Chocolate, and not even real sugar helped!  The Sugar Free version is simply a waste of money in my opinion.  If adding real sugar does not improve the taste, you know there is something in this product which is not very good, and I think it is the Splenda sugar substitute.  Personally, I have always found Equal to be the best sugar substitute.  I have never used Splenda or products containing Splenda before, but I think Equal would have been a much, much better choice for sugar substitution here.<br /><br />My advice is not to purchase the sugar free varieties because they are just not very tasty and leave such an unpleasant aftertaste. Buy the regular varieties, if you must, and use them once in a while as a treat in your coffee or your soda instead of having a dessert for example.  Also, be prepared to keep your spoon in cup in order to keep stirring your coffee before each sip to keep the syrup mixed in the coffee, otherwise, it separates and can be seen to sort of float on the top in a very unappealing way. I cannot understand why it will not stay well mixed in coffee. There is a lot of room for improvement of this product."

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

I saw this as a relatively cheap alternative to the raw diet I had them on which was great quality but took a lot of work to prepare (the pre-prepped one was even more expensive).<br /><br />For anyone who's done research on dog food, we all know that raw is the best diet we can feed our dogs, it gives them nutritional content, probiotics, moisture, all the things that they need to thrive. For anyone who's been on high grade dog foods, you also know that you can switch foods for your dogs without any concern about stomach/bowel issues. Be forewarned, this is NOT the case with Sojos.<br /><br />I had been feeding my dogs Nature's Variety Instinct Raw (switching as I please between the protein varieties) and Orijen (I switch between all the Orijen flavors). I normally did half in the morning and half a night using one type of food for each feeding. I figure, why not throw Sojos into the mix to give them some variety and save some money. That's when problems instantly began.<br /><br />They liked the food at first, it was new and exciting and they gobbled it up, then when it made its way through their system, they had very runny stool. It was still not too bad and I could understand minor transition time, but by the end of day 1 it was full on diarrhea. I spent an entire weekend (and then some) nursing them back to health, fully on Nature's Variety Instinct mixed with organic pumpkin to settle the stomach. But I spent the majority of my time walking them, and being heartbroken to see bloody stool (knowing I had caused it by carelessly choosing a poor quality dog food product).<br /><br />I know some will argue, 'you didn't transition your dogs,' but honestly, when you stay in the high quality spectrum of dog foods you don't have to. Especially when you know your dogs don't have problems. I've fed them Blue, Candiae, Nature's Variety, Great Life, Orijen, Acana, Nature's Variety Instinct Raw, Earthborn, EVO. And that's not even adding to the mix the versions of those foods that have grain and grain free varieties. I've NEVER had a problem with switching them back and forth.<br /><br />So, this is certainly a better option that Science Diet, but it isn't for everyone, and it certainly isn't for people who want to feed their dogs the best stuff they can. This is NOT a replacement for a raw diet. Please take caution before switching.<br /><br />(Also I read a reviewer who cooks their proteins before feeding it to their dog, how does that not completely defeat the purpose in feeding raw in the first place?)"

Shreve ""Dorian Grey""",1,1,1,1310947200,You couldn't pay me to drink this!,"I recently started researching the benefits of drinking coconut water and consuming coconut oil daily because I have been trying to change my lifestyle from one of total nutricious abandon to healthy yet happy.  I absolutely love cooking with coconut oil, adding it to my morning coffee, using it as a skin moisturizer, anything and everything I possibly can use it for, and have been telling all of my friends and family.  I never really liked coconut so it did take a little bit to get used to the coconut taste with the oil.  The coconut water, however, was a little trickier.  I knew it would be very beneficial to hydrate myself with it after a hard workout so this is what I decided to do: I bought the Zico 14-ounce bottle of natural coconut water from my local supermarket and also bought a can of Goya's coconut water with pulp to see which one I would be able to drink.  I tried the Zico first thinking that since it's in a plastic bottle and so much more expensive it would be the natural winner.  I had chilled the coconut water in the fridge all day and when I opened the bottle and poured it into a glass I noticed a funny odor immediately.  After my first taste I was horrified at how terrible it was.  It's hard to describe, kind of plastic(y), bitter, and just nasty!  I've had coconut water/milk straight from a coconut before and it was delightful, Zico's does not taste a THING like that.  I know that this has no added sugar whereas Goya adds a little and Zico is ""supposedly"" pure but from concentrate.  I tried another sip thinking that it would grow on me, but no, not one little bit.  I then decided to open up the Goya, cautiously I tried it and I LOVED the coconut pulp and the taste immediately.  I know everyone has different tastes and I will admit that I was never a coconut lover before, but I figured since I have grown to love coconut oil I would be okay, but again, it may be an acquired taste.  My suggestion would be to try a can/bottle of different brands before you give up on drinking coconut water.  I am so glad that I didn't just buy the Zico because I would have signed off on even trying if I hadn't had the Goya right there to redeem itself."

If my stance on those three ""issues"" was different, I might love this product... as it is, I found it to be somewhat disgusting.<br /><br />I typically drink Meijer branded chocolate shake mix (Meijer is a western US mega-store & the shake mix is a knock-off of what slimfast puts in a can).  I hoped that this mix would taste at least somewhat (even a little bit) like the meijer brand.... The ways that I described this taste to my wife each morning... well, they aren't good... I'm listing a few:<br /><br />- It tasted like rope<br />- It tasted like licking a wet horses bridle<br />- It tasted like sucking the water out of a wet hemp bracelet<br />- It tasted like someone had mixed dirt in with my unsweetened baker's cocoa<br />- It tasted like chewing on tree bark<br /><br />In all seriousness, the ""rope"" & ""wet hemp bracelet"" analogies are the closest... I used to wear a lot of hemp (before doing so was part of the ""organic"" eating movement I guess?)... and I remember chewing on the necklace/bracelets.  This product tastes just like that.<br /><br />Another note - I was not impressed by the blending of this stuff.  Most shake mixes actually dissolve in liquid; this stuff just sorta clumped into the liquid.<br /><br />On the other hand, I ate (almost) all of it... and it was much more palatable once I mixed it in with the meijer shake mix (2 parts meijer mix, 1 part this stuff).  The fiber content is really high (always a plus).. and it was fairly reasonable.<br /><br />So, if you are into the earth loving hipster movement or are just a standard faire hippy - this stuff might be for you.

Better alternatives out there for low carbers,"My local Italian restaurant knows I'm low carb, so the chef was excited to tell me they found a great low carb pasta. I was quite excited too - he had purchased this brand, it was very good.<br /><br />BUT ... I went online to order it for myself, and actually read the nutritional count. It's NOT low carb. In fact, it's HIGHER carbs than many mainstream whole grain pastas!<br /><br />I checked the supermarket shelf - you don't even have to go to the health food isle to find lower carbs than this. The General Mills, Kraft, Barilla, even Trader Joe's whole grain pastas (starting at $0.99 cents per box) have on average 17.5 carbs (less 1.5 fiber = 16 net carbs).<br /><br />To be fair, the ""CarbNada"" brand has a generous portion size - 1.5 cups. I would probably not eat more than 1 cup at a time, so my serving size would be 12 net carbs. But still, the Atkins brand has half the carbs compared to this! (usually 4-8 net carbs per serving).<br /><br />My suggested alternatives:<br /><br />* Atkins has a few pastas that start at 4 net carbs. I will not eat a packaged pasta that's higher than 5 or 6 net carbs.<br /><br />* Use julienned zucchini or squash instead of pasta - use it raw (soaked in olive oil for a few minutes), cook it (like mac & cheese), or lightly steam it in the microwave or in a steamer. It's much much healthier than packaged/processed pasta anyway, and almost zero net carbs. (You might want to skin it first)<br /><br />* The best veggie to use for pasta is cucazza. You must always skin cucazza, then run it through a mandolin slicer on the julienne setting. Seriously, this takes 20 seconds.<br /><br />* And, the BEST low carb pasta I've ever had is made from kelp - dehydrated kelp noodles. This one is not found in most stores, but you can find it online. Kelp is one of the best foods you should be eating, low carb or not. High in protein, high in minerals/vitamins/nutrients, and very low carbs (about 1 net carb), and nearly zero glycemic index. Plus, the noodles don't have to be boiled - just put in warm water for about 60 seconds. And they work with everything.<br /><br />* Keep looking for other brands. They're out there. The best low carb breads and pastas are made from flax seeds. If you like the refined flour, light & fluffy breads & pastas, the best brands use a combination of soy isolate + almond flour &/or flax.<br /><br />Bottom line: I believe this company's product labeling is opportunistic & slightly disingenuous. There are much better alternatives."

What a cute little acronym!  So tiny and innocent.  What are you doing in my chocolate, little PGPR?  You wern't there a few years ago.  Let's find out what you are.<br /><br />PGPR is known in the candy industry as polyglycerol polyricinoleate.<br /><br />Wow.  Cool!  Wonder why they put you in my Hershey's chocolate bar.  Could it be because it makes the chocolate better?<br /><br />Of course not.  PGRP is used to replace the expensive cocoa butter that is normally found in chocolate.<br /><br />Well, is it better for you?<br /><br />Of course not.<br /><br />What you need to know:<br /><br />The 1996 study conducted by Andrew Waterhouse of UC Davis which discovered the phenols (potent antioxidants) in chocolate also revealed that these antioxidants come from cocoa butter and the stearic acid it produces. It demonstrated that the phenols prevented LDL cholesterol from building up in arteries. Another study had subjects follow diets in which the majority of fat calories came from either chocolate or butter; only those with the butterfat diet showed an increase in LDL cholesterol.<br /><br />This is why dark chocolate, which usually contains between about 30% and 50% cocoa butter, is touted for its antioxidant properties, and a bar of Hershey's milk chocolate is not. Unfortunately, Hershey's in particular - one of the biggest users of PGPR - has also moved to take advantage of the new healthier perception of dark chocolate. Not only have they begun buying small high-end chocolate producers like Scharffen-Berger and Joseph Schmidt Chocolates, but they have also expanded their dark chocolate line and begun marketing it heavily as a healthy treat. Besides the irony of their simultaneous replacement of antioxidant-filled cocoa butter with PGPR in their cheaper chocolates, they have put corn syrup in many items from the more expensive and supposedly healthy dark chocolate line.<br /><br />This is the kind of behavior that buying PGPR-enhanced chocolate supports. Dishonest; unscrupulous; pulling the wool over consumers' eyes. Read your ingredient listings carefully, and research the unfamiliar, and you can feed your mind as well as your body."

To render the oil from fish requires a technological approach. If you keep improving the technique, the fish residue eventually has so little oil that a cat might not be able to detect it. The ""food"" would be produced from fresh fish, as advertised, and would allow the manufacturer to receive a revenue from the residue as well as the human supplement.

The steak is overdone and tastes too fatty, sweet and vinegary.  In fact, at the restaurant, they actually tip the plate up and take a big spoonful of the fat that has drained to the bottom, and poor it like sauce over your steak serving. Crazy, in my opinion.  Anyway, this retail version of the sauce is just as bad: tons of sugar and mostly vinegar.  Marinate your steak in this and all you'll taste is the vinegar.  This sauce will ruin a good cut of meat.  From good to best, buy shell (aka strip), sirloin, top sirloin, porterhouse, tenderloin (aka filet mignon) and use a non-vinegar-based marinade, like wine and herbs."

You could have fit several of those bags in the box, but I got only one. It would take 4 of these pig ears to equal the size of just one that I can buy from my local pet food store for about $1.00 a piece. That is no exaggeration. To help you visualize this, the average size pig ear is smaller than my computer mouse (and I have a typical mouse. All I can say is don't make the mistake I made. After reading the other reviews I thought this would be a quality product. Well, while it appears that it was at one time, it certainly isn't anymore. I weighed the bag and it was a bit over 4 pounds. I paid $80 after shipping. That means I paid roughly $20 per pound for this junk!

429304,B003MWBFMK,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,6,15,1,1291420800,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

So I then offered it to our Lab/Golden mix, a dog that loves nothing more than snapping up the cat's food if it is left within her reach.  One sniff and she jerked her head back from it and walked away.  Next step was to fling it out into the back yard where the grackles (an omnivorous bird common to South Texas) scavenge for moldy bread, pizza bones, stale chips and pretty much anything else we toss out.

I instantly fell in love with the drink when it first came out. Its 70% juice formula was to die for. When they changed it to 50% juice, I was a little disappointed since the drink seemed a little unhealthier. However, since the difference in taste was minuscule and since 50% juice is better than no juice, I let it slide. The new Rockstar Juiced is disgusting. It is packed with more sugar and calories compared to the old version and the difference in taste is very noticeable. The after feeling I got from drinking the new one was very uneasy and unsatisfying. I was an avid drinker of Rockstar Juiced. I drank at least one per day, sometimes two. I will now have to revert back to coffee & redbull. At least I am not completely heartbroken since some of my local grocery stores still carry the 50% version. But once they are completely out, goodbye Rockstar Juiced. I will miss you."

So that is what I kept feeding her without knowing what I know now that I have read this site. But it seemed ok - she had really hard poops sometimes but otherwise seemed great and her coat was soft and shiny, enough so that people commented on it. THEN after the formula change this year, the itching started and the poops became worse (hard more often.) She developed red spots in her ears and a yeast infection in each one.  Then her fur got rough, dusty looking and then started shedding more than anything I'd seen in the 2 years I had her. It seemed like she lost 1/2 her fur! The vets told me this was not likely the new food formula of her same food...well after hundreds of dollars of vet bills and a miserable summer for her all itchy all of the time, I decided to change her food. I picked Halo after talking to a friend who is in to nutrition (people and dogs.) I changed her over slowly - about 9 days. The itching and fur remained a problem...until the day she was only on Halo. Poof! No more itching - that very day no more itching. After a month her fur was shiny and soft but sparce (I'd added Halo's Dreamcoat supplement too.) After 2 months her fur is shinier, softer and more full and lush than ever. Her poops are regular like clockwork and soft - like they never were on Purina One. And she *loves* the food! (I do a mix of canned and kibble.) She has a passion for that food she never had for Purina One - even before the formula change. I wish I'd listened to my instincts and switched the food after the first symptoms! Whatever Purina did to that food is a nightmare.  Read about in on line - you'll see many people have had very bad results since the formula change last summer."

435617,B000HDI5O8,A2CGORRQGDEL37,T.C. Owens,7,7,1,1283990400,"Good pumpkin, BUT too many heavily dented cans!","I bought 2 cases (24 cans) of this product from Amazon.com.  Out of the 24 cans, 5 were undented, 10 were badly dented, and 9 were extremely dented with 3 of those being crushed in half.  The crushed cans were in the center of one package of 12.  Each case had 12 cans in it and was wrapped tightly in bubble wrap.  The 2 cases were inside a larger box.  There was no damage to any of the boxes.  Other reviewers of this product have talked about these cans arriving dented in similar fashion to what I experienced but I took a  chance and hoped for the success other reviewers have experienced.  Lady Luck was not on my side.  Fortunately, by googling the product's name I found Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin at another supplier who sent me a case that only had 2 slightly dented cans and 10 perfect cans for the same price plus nominal shipping.  Amazon.com is a good company and I know they'll refund my money for the case of horribly dented cans that I returned.  However, this issue has been going on for some time as evidenced by the reviews.  Where the problem lies, I do not know but I will not buy this product again from Amazon.com until the dented can issue has been resolved.<br /><br />As to the product itself, the pumpkin is delicious.  It's not solid like Libby's pumpkin, but it works well for my recipes.  It has the consistency of baby food and is slightly more yellow than Libby's pumpkin.  There is a recipe on the can for pumpkin pie using condensed sweetened milk.  I prefer Libby's recipe so instead of 14 oz. of condensed sweetened milk, I use 12 oz. of evaporated milk and 1/2 c. of sugar because we like it less sweet.  The product I can recommend and would've given it 5 stars for the pumpkin alone, but the ongoing, horribly dented can issue lost it 4 points.  The dents really are that bad and some are so badly dented that if they can be opened, they may represent a health hazard.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Amazon.com is a great company.  It refunded my money for the badly dented cans.  Today, I also received my second order from another online company and while it had fewer dented cans in it, the badly/severely dented cans were in the middle of the 12-pack case just like they were in the 2 cases I had ordered from Amazon.com.  The problem seems to lie with the manufacturer.  I've emailed  Farmer's Market Foods, Inc., twice but have heard nothing from the company.  I won't be buying this product again.  Over 50% of the 48 cans had bad to severe dents, of which at least 3 were crushed almost in half.  Badly dented cans may be unsafe to use (e.g., botulism, bacteria).  The tops and bottoms may seem fine (unswollen) at first, but if the seal is microscopically breached, it may not be fine months from now.  So, when it comes to this product and the company's continued shipping of badly dented and crushed cans in the middle of the case, all I can say is:  ""caveat emptor."""

I compared the box to my old one and found the same SKU number but the roast level has been dropped from medium to very light along with the color change. My taste test revealed exactly that... a mild, relatively tasteless coffee more like their dishwater Daybreak than the old Caribou blend. Caribou (I got this second hand) claims that their flagship blend is more of a light roast than a medium roast and they made the change accordingly. Yeah, sure. Nice try but we all know that the wholesale price of coffee has skyrocketed. Sounds to me, the skeptic, that perhaps they have been forced to switch to a cheaper coffee with less gusto and more bitterness to maintain their competitive price points. How sad. I would have gladly paid more for my favorite. The new blend is far inferior. If you're a regular, have someone brew both and I bet you'll have no problem distinguishing the difference.

I almost spit out my first sip all over the table and had to run to the bathroom because I was gagging. I made it back to the table (barely) and asked the waiter what in the wide world of sports happened to the coffee.<br /><br />He said that they were filming a television commercial for Folger's and they were secretly replacing their coffee with Folger's to film people's reactions to the coffee switch. Needless to say I didn't get to be in the commercial. It wouldn't have been very savvy marketing for Folger's to show some guy gagging and making a beeline for the bathroom after tasting their coffee.<br /><br />I don't know where they got those people in the commercials to rave about the coffee because there wasn't anyone in the restaurant doing it. Most people didn't have my reaction but a lot of them were making faces like they'd just smelled a dead octopus. It was a dirty trick. You'd think Folger's would have bagged this idea for a commercial seeing people's reactions but I guess they found some schmo to say he liked it. Someone wanting to be on TV, go figure."

I am a (recent) former user of Evanger's pet food products, and have no affiliation with them, or with anyone else in the pet food industry.  I deeply regret having ever fed any animal Evanger's products, especially animals I love and care for.  Of course, you must do your own research and draw your own conclusions about these matters.  Evanger's has made an explanation of their side of things in some of these matters, although I personally found their ""reasons""  entirely unconvincing.<br /><br />I would strongly urge you to research this company for yourself.  In particular, read about the FDA's revocation of their permit for failing to process the food properly, and read about the arrest of the owners on charges that they committed millions of dollars worth of utilities fraud by operating their plant for years with the gas and electric meters bypassed.  If, as alleged, they were operating with stolen utility service, what shortcuts would they be willing to take with your pet's health and safety to reduce manufacturing costs?  And in the vein of cutting costs, read about the successful lawsuit by employees for just under half of a million dollars in unpaid overtime wages.<br /><br />I can't post web links here, but my sources include a Chicago Tribune Article dated March 25, 2010, titled ""Lincolnwood couple charged in utility theft scheme"" and two articles on the FDA web site entitled ""FDA Orders Pet Food Maker to Obtain Emergency Operating Permit"" and ""FDA Suspends Temporary Emergency Permit of Pet Food Maker"".  I would also mention the lawsuit against Evanger's by their employees, which Evanger's appears to have lost.  (Source: web site ""Truth About Pet Food"") The Northern District of Illinois Distric Court, Case: 1:09-cv-00227, filed 9/15/2010, Final Approval Order Francisco Barragan and Liberto DeLaRosa, on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated persons (Plantiffs) versus Evanger's Dog and Cat Food Co., Inc., Holly N.

I found only one half of a peanut in one of the two sections of the candy bar.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Much of the candy bar is chalk full of artificial flavors and fillers.  Although the ingredient peanut butter is prominently displayed on the packaging, it is listed as peanut butter (peanuts, partially hydrogenated soybean oil).<br /><br />The chocolate also has a rather diet flavor, and is listed as milk chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, chocolate, skim milk, lactose, milkfat, soy lecithin, artificial flavor).  It doesn't taste like chocolate.<br /><br />So, don't waste the calories on this flavorless dud.  It's not worth the 13 g fat, 6 g sat. fat, 24 g sugar, and 150 mg of sodium.  Go for the traditional to satisfy your craving for a nutty and tasty chocolate treat.<br /><br />It does not have the hefty weight of the traditional candy bar so you get less candy for your money.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />The packing is brightly colored and appealing.  The product is divided into two small square shaped sections that allow you to save one for later.  It has the Snickers logo prominently displayed on the brightly colored yellow package."

When you check it against Ella's website, it HAS NO CALCIUM%! Same goes for all the other stage 1 Ella's fruits (butternut squash, carrots, apples, prunes: 30% calcium on package but 2% on the website, carrots, apples, parsnips 30% calcium on package vs. 0% on website all the same serving size) -- there were other differences too in protein, iron, etc. It does cost a lot more than some of the other organic baby fruits out there and tastes awful. If your baby is just as content with the other less expensive organic baby fruits out there, go with the cheaper alternative because nutrition wise, Ella's no better!<br /><br />What a disgusting marketing ploy by Ella's Kitchen to get parents to choose their products because it is falsely more nutritious when it's the same as other organic baby fruits in terms of nutritional value."

We tried all the tricks to get it to work, reset the transmitter and receiver, fresh batteries, moved the meat probe, etc.  Nothing worked.<br /><br />It has been more than 90 days since I ordered this product, so I called the Brookstone Limited Warranty Service at the 800 number listed in the manual.

Today, he could have died eating one.<br /><br />Although I'm an anesthesiologist, and half of my job is to ""protect people's airways"", one needn't be a medical professional to realize why these biscuits are dangerous.  Most babies get their front teeth (upper and lower incisors) first, long before molars arrive.  So, they're limited to biting with their front teeth, and only mashing with their gums (where their molars will someday erupt).  These biscuits are great for the first 5 minutes, baby happily chomping away on the hard surface.  Then, they soften.  Pretty soon, baby bites clean through the biscuit with their front teeth (size of chunk depending on how far they had inserted it into their mouth at the time), and the chunk that remains in their mouth is WAY too hard to mash with gums.  Baby has nothing to do but try to spit it out (difficult at this age), or swallow it whole (if lucky enough for it to be a small piece), or have it completely occlude their airway.  We were able to quickly fish one large chunk out with our fingers, but our poor soon started gagging, tearing, and wretched once before something resolved (still don't know if he swallowed a large piece or if it ended up on ground), but not before we scooped him up and tried to knock it loose with some back blows.<br /><br />In any case, although the kids may love these, all it would take would be one infant death from choking to prompt a recall or something.

The smell of coffee is appetizing and enhances the taste, but since I already had an issue with the smell, the coffee ended up tasting weak and stale.  The process of removing most of the acid must affect the taste and smell as well as color because it took away the best parts of coffee, the appetizing smell, the rich slight bitter taste, and the dark, smoky caramel color.

On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.<br /><br />After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. ""Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds"". Dogster-com<br /><br />Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.<br /><br />In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog."

They crumble easily... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min, and she's only about 15 pounds right now. They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris. For my dog this was BS... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur. The mess wasn't an issue.. the durability was. This is basically an expensive treat, I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat (and they last longer).

Since the roots are not attached to anything, the tomato plants fall over in all directions. You can TRY to follow the instructions to tie them up somehow but the reality with the garden is that it is not easy to do so. There is only the one hood support to use. So even using garden ties, velcro, etc, the plants are always flopping around. If Aerogrow is reading this - I have a suggestion for you: Use the four ""unused"" holes in the tray to hold some sort of support towers for plants that get that big or need to climb.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

I like Wellness, I consistently buy the hard food and one of my cats really enjoyed their sliced chicken in the 3 oz cans.  The only reason I tried this was because the other cat wouldn't eat the chicken slices and the the 3 oz cans are too expensive to keep wasting on him and I didn't want to have to buy different food for each.  But I guess I'll being going back to the slices and he'll have to get used to the slices as the diarrhea isn't worth it.  Maybe I just received an old batch.

He told me it was most likely from her food and asked what we feed her.  I told him we feed her IAMS Large Breed food, and he said that it was probably the problem.<br /><br />He said we didn't need to treat it at the level that it was at, but that if she got to where she was shaking her ears a lot, or pawing at them, or if we noticed other symptoms, we would want to try a better diet to see if it fixed it.<br /><br />So, our dog's ears got worse.  She was constantly shaking her ears.  Her skin developed really bad dandruff.  She used to be really obedient, but she became really naughty.  I called the vet's office and we're switching her to a wheat-free corn-free diet now.  Last week we transitioned her over and this week we have already seen a little improvement; she doesn't shake her ears much at all anymore.  We'll watch and see if the dandruff and behavior problems also go away.  I am hopeful that they will.<br /><br />Maybe some dogs can eat this and be fine--our dog LIKES eating IAMS food...but it's just really obvious that it hasn't been good for her.  Until her vet told me, I had no idea that dog foods have so much bad stuff in them.  Dogs are carnivores, so it makes sense that they have problems on a wheat and corn diet.  The vet didn't try to sell us any particular brand of food, he just suggested trying a wheat and corn free brand for a couple months to see how it goes.  We are trying Nutro Natural Choice now.<br /><br />Too bad.  $50-60/bag dog food for a Great Dane is going to add up."

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever.

We got it today and I opened it up and all of the cans were minct chocolate flaovor. I thought they sent the wrong kind... I checked my order and found out I indeed ordered the wrong flavor. See, the canisters look EXACTLY the same except the milk chocolate flavor has a small brown strip in the middle and the mint chocolate has a small green strip in the middle. That's the ONLY difference between the canisters. And since the initial thumbnail images on Amazon are so small, it's easy to not see such a little difference. yes, its' technically my fault, but they need more difference in artwork on the canisters. Not only that, Amazon would not take it back, even though it all was unopened, because its ""food"". and the company who makes it basically said ""Sorry, but it sucks to be you"".

I recently changed back over to Wellness and Felidae as I have noticed that the EVO food has been changing colors. It (EVO Duck for cats) is now a nasty gray color, no longer the rich red/brown color duck is known to have. It also has no congealed juice/gravy on the top of the food any more. This is usually found in good cooked food made with fowl.<br /><br />Over the past 2 months I have noticed a change in smell, color and consistency. Another clue that something was different was that my cats had started getting sick after eating, lots of vomiting. It was starting to smell like regular old rancid cat food where with old EVO you could actually smell what meat was used (it actually smelt GOOD). It makes me wonder what kind of rendered crap is in there now!<br /><br />I have written P&G and was promised that there would be no change made in recipe, meat sources and other ingredients within the first year. The year anniversary for the buyout was in January 2011. I had been assured a few months ago that they would still be procuring everything (same grade) from the same sources that EVO had used before being bought out. With that year over with, I have seen new changes every time I look in a can.<br /><br />Having worked in a vet hospital in the past, I know that pet food industries are NOT required to make changes on the food label until 6 months AFTER the change has been made in the formula. I am very aware of the mess P&G got into with the Melamine a few years ago and I don't want to risk it. I have opted to go back to Wellness (yes they had a recall recently, but were great about quickly buying back food. They also have put in other measures that I am comfortable with to prevent this from occurring again)and Felidae. Both of these foods are manufactured by original owners who have set standards with both brands.<br /><br />I will not risk it and I would advise anyone thinking about EVO to do a little homework before purchasing. It looks to me like they are charging top dollar for sub standard quality."

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

1321,B004EKO2HE,A1RQQ2HWUGEUWA,EB MamaBear,3,3,1,1323820800,"NOT what I originally ordered! BOO, amazon!","As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.<br />I am really confused/irritated how my review for ""alive and aware raw cacao"" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say ""out of stock"" or ""currently unavailable"" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?<br />Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.<br />I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.<br />Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the ""brands"" and ""vendors"" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.<br /><br />For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.<br />Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You!"

It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo."

I even used to make my own when I was younger. I've tried a variety of brands before but this is the first time trying out Wild Ride. It claims to be Hormone and Nitrate free with no added MSG, and while the ingredients listed do confirm their claims this beef jerky has got to be some of the driest, tasteless I have ever eaten.<br /><br />Kickin' Teriyaki is the flavor I got. To be sure I didn't just get a bad package I opened two bags and both sets of jerky was dry and tasteless. I do not taste anything ""kickin"" about this jerky and there is virtually no Teriyaki flavor either. To make things worse the dry jerky tends to have a powdery taste to it because it is made with Soy Sauce POWDER instead of Soy Sauce (this is to get around saying it has no added MSG). Instead of imparting a nice Teriyaki flavor you get this powedery taste to the jerky and mixed with the bit of onion and corn starch in the jerky, it almost is like they coated it with onion powder instead of Teriyaki.<br /><br />On the plus side however, this is a nitrate free product which is a good thing as many other jerkies tend to have Sodium Nitrate in them. Also with both packages I have opened currently, the jerky breaks down easily and isn't tough as leather nor does it contain any sinew it seems.<br /><br />OVERALL this jerky just seems extremely tasteless and powdery. While it doesn't contain ""added"" MSG, Nitrates or hormones, they got around this by using powdered versions of ingredients (powdered vinegar and soy sauce) plus it contains Dextrose and Fructose , modified food starch and corn starch and SUGAR is your second ingredient. I've never seen so much sugar and starch added to jerky in my life. So despite being hormone and nitrate free, this jerky (in my opinion) is barely palatable and should be avoided"

The issue, the major issue, is that it simple taste ugly. Adults may tell you that any baby food will taste ugly anyway, but me and my toddler agreed that bitterness, and awful taste is the best describer for this product. It has been such a ""shock"" that he does not drink anything that looks like milk anymore. So, save your time and money, if your toddler already knows the taste of real milk, he/she will just pull this one away. Now, I have to mix milk with other things to try to make him like it again.

It might also be better in baked goods (on the label it recommends using the product for ""frosting, sauces, puddings, and other recipes as a substitute for vanilla extract"").  Liquid vanilla extract contains alcohol and slightly thins what you're making -- I see an advantage in using a powdered vanilla if you want to avoid these characteristics.<br /><br />I'm giving the product a chance and want to like it, but it's the most artificial tasting real vanilla I've had.

That means you can apply it liberally and it's unlikely you will make any dish too hot. So it is user friendly.<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): Aged cayenne peppers, distilled vinegar, water, salt - etc<br /><br />Yet why have I rated it 2 stars? The simple answer it has far too much vinegar and it ends up tasting like vinegar and a bit bitter too. In addition, this sauce lacks any character beyond that heavy dose of vinegar. Now, if you happen to like a lot of vinegar in your hot sauce - then you might love this sauce and my 2 star rating is way off base. I don't like anywhere near this much vinegar. I've blind taste tested over 30 hot sauces and there are much better ones, including ones that have a fair amount of vinegar.<br /><br />What is interesting is that the original Tabasco sauce has a near identical taste to Franks once it is diluted.<br /><br />BTW: You will find mention that this sauce was top rated by Cooks Illustrated. That is absolutely true but what these pundits fail to mention is this was a casual test, done in 2005, comparing only three hot sauces!<br /><br />Suggestion: Since tastes vary and if you happen to like this sauce - then you can save a lot of money by buying it in one of its larger sizes - at least 23 oz and consider the gallon size. They don't cost much more than the smaller sizes.<br /><br />I'd encourage everyone to experiment with a sauce that is not so heavily laden with vinegar or is at least - better balanced.<br /><br />Try any of these:<br /><br />a) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - This sauce has considerable heat but it is nicely balanced against a bit of sweetness combined with a vague hint of garlic. Virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the Asian section! It has no vinegar, is considerably more potent than Franks, yet just a bit sweet. Compared to Franks you have to be careful not to add too much.<br /><br />b) Cholula Original Hot Sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - low to medium heat and readily available - look in the Mexican section. It has a hint of vinegar but is diluted, much like Franks yet with a far superior taste. Highly recommended<br /><br />c) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Extra Hot Sauce - a great blend with more vinegar than the above but not too much. Another great blend and not so hot that it is unforgiving.<br /><br />d) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Hot Sauce - a decent blend but with a lot of vinegar. Still it is much better than Franks.<br /><br />e) Tapatio Hot Salsa Picanta - another widely distributed and excellent Mexican Hot sauce. A lot of vinegar but still far less than Franks.

We fed them Temptations for years, before we really took the time to read the labels and understand what the ingredients really were. That brand is about the same as flavored potato chips for humans - flavor enhancers are added to make us crave the item. Temptations does the same for your cat. No wonder they didn't want to stop eating them!<br /><br />Anyway, we were on the hunt for a healthier treat that wasn't full of kitty junk food.<br />Both our cats love chicken and could care less about tuna or fish flavors, so this was one of the items we tried.<br />The ingredients are top-notch, and the treat's size is really good for cats.<br /><br />However, while both cats get excited about the bag being opened (like a can opener sound or popping the lid on wet cat food),<br />I could swear I hear them sigh when they see this bag! While they do eat these, it isn't a favorite by any means. Both will eat a few pieces then walk away, almost unheard of in all previous treat feeds of all brands. I can leave a few out and they'll get eaten, but it is probably out of boredom, not because they want them. One of our favorite games with both cats is tossing a treat for them to catch. They both love to do this, but are too bored to play catch with these treats. While I am glad that these do not contain the kitty version of MSG, it also needs to have something more appealing to the cats too.<br /><br />There is enough chicken in this to make it a decent product for your cat. However, there also doesn't seem to be a lot of flavor, in their opinion. While I did not buy mine at Amazon, no matter where you shop, Halo treats are pretty costly, given what<br />they are - little round pieces of cat food.<br /><br />We won't be buying them again. For a few dollars more, we can get a 3-lb sack of very healthy cat food that we can use as treats instead. Right now, we are using Blue Buffalo cat food as their treat. They both adore it, it is full of healthy ingredients too (despite being more grains than I really think cats need), and you get a lot more value. We also use Eukanuba dry food as treats, and both of those brands are very popular with both of our cats.<br /><br />So, while everyone's cats have different likes/dislikes just like we humans do, I'd put my money into some other brand.<br />If this one came way down in price, then it would be an okay value as an extra treat.<br />But, for the premium pricing on a bag of treats, you can do just as well by your cat with other brands.<br />There is nothing really special about these, and don't have either the flavor or fragrance to get our cats too excited about them.<br />I think we were all a little disappointed with the Halo chicken treats."

I'm not sure how much teeth cleaning the Xylitol in the gum itself is doing because it seems to lose flavor so fast. Correct me if I'm wrong, but xylitol is a sweetener, so if the sweetness of the gum is lost after a good (or bad?) 3 minutes, then there really wasn't that much Xylitol to begin with?<br /><br />Also, further research showed that you actually need more xylitol than the amount in the gum itself before it proves to be beneficial.<br /><br />Given how much xylitol is in the Spry gum, it's neither good nor bad to be chewing Spry, and what tips that balance towards ""No Thanks"" is the fact that it is not worth its value.<br /><br />This is USEFUL information for those who want to chew gum to freshen their breath, or prolong the feeling of minty goodness in their mouth for more than just a couple of minutes!"

So I found this black currant tea and figured it would be good -- it's Twining's after all -- and I went for six boxes of 20 teabags each.  Now I realize -- I probably should have paid closer attention to the illustration of the box -- that it's artificially flavored.  These teabags smell artificial compared to Peet's, and the black currant aroma of these teabags is faint compared to what I experience when I open a tin of Peet's.  When I brew a mug of tea, it has adequate flavor, but the black currant flavor is overshadowed by the artificial boysenberry-like flavoring they've added and that detracts.

Later in the day, you could do the same regimen except split a caff. tab in half so you're not up at 4am thinking about stuff you usually never think about. If you find that this stack is getting you too nervous and you're using it for learning tasks, add an L-theanine to the group and you should be good to go. If you're the knowledge-seeking type, you can also check out Huperzine-A, Alpha-GPC, and 5-HTP, and how they work on the dopaminergic system to see if you want to consider placing them in a rotating nootropic stack (taking them all at once would be a mistake)<br /><br />They're a business, I get it.

Just to give it a fair shot, I tried brewing and drinking it four different ways:<br /><br />1.Mild with no sugar or cream<br />2. Strong with no sugar or cream<br />3. Mild with sugar and cream<br />4. Strong with sugar and cream<br /><br />I also had friends taste test this. We all hated it. We couldn't choke it down as it was truly bitter and unpleasant. Maybe we got a bad batch or bag. At this point, we have nearly a whole bag left and I'm feeling guilty about wasting it. But there is no way I'm going to brew another pot of coffee and try to create a tasty brew. I tend to like my coffee extremely strong but even making it overly strong did not make it better. Yes, the vanilla flavor came through but it wasn't a good addition to a possibly decent coffee (without the vanilla)."

I did not purchase this product from Amazon, but my local Whole Foods market just a couple days ago. Normally I'm not one to do reviews, but since this product is so expensive, I wanted to share my experience.<br /><br />I've been working really hard recently to cut my sugar intake. After reading rave reviews on Amazon about Sweet Tree Coconut Palm sugar, and doing a little research, I debated for 2 weeks, and then decided to just go get some even though it was $5 for a pound. (my health is more important) I started out by using some in my steel cut oats yesterday, which I really liked! I also used it in my coffee yesterday in place of regular sugar, but I noticed little dark things floated to the top. I know it's pretty raw, so I figured, maybe they were little fibers from the tree, or perhaps it was something with that batch of coffee? So I just scooped the little dark floaters out, and drank my coffee. Which tasted pretty good with the palm sugar! I was so pleased, that I was very excited to have my coffee this morning with my new found sweetener.<br /><br />This morning (not more than 10 minutes ago) I made some coffee again with my palm sugar, and before I even had a chance to drink it... more little floaters! As I pushed them to the sides of my white cup, one I noticed for sure had LEGS on it! Yes, my friends... it was a BUG!! I dumped my coffee imediately, and made some more with(unfortunately) my raw organic sugar that I still have. No floaters. So it's definitely not in the coffee... it's in the palm sugar! Has anyone else had an experience/noticed this? I know it's supposed to be healthier and all... but for $5 I'd like my sugar to not have little bugs in it. That's NOT the extra minerals I had in mind! Maybe I just got a bad bag?  It's not my intention to bad mouth this company -- but I would want someone to tell me if they knew I was eating/drinking little bugs. I haven't contacted the company just yet, as I just noticed it for sure this morning.

The grinds didn't stick to the grinder and the lid because there were no oils to bind it.  A disappointment!<br /><br />I thought to myself though, that the proof is in the taste.  So I brewed a pot and confirmed my suspicion; the coffee lacked depth and really tasted like coffee flavored water.

The problem is that you can only make about four servings of food at a time.  I'm a working mom, so I need to make two weeks worth of food at a time and freeze it.  That means at least six batches in the Beaba, which would take hours.  In addition, the plastic is pretty thin, so I'm afraid to put the parts in the dishwasher.  This means HAND washing!  Add the descaling requirements, and this thing takes more time to clean than to cook with.<br /><br />The steamer also doesn't have any kind of 'off' signal, so if you have 'mommy brain' and walk away from it while it is steaming, it won't remind you when it is finished so you might come back long after the food has gone cold and then you have to throw it out.  The food processor blade is really inefficient so it takes a long time to get a consistent texture.  If you are processing anything starchy, that means it gets pretty glutinous by the time all the big chunks are out of the batch.<br /><br />For the price, you can get a full size steamer (that chimes when finished), and basic food processor or hand blender that will blend the food faster and more evenly.  And you can use those products for the whole family, not just the limited time the baby needs pureed food.  The Black & Decker steamer is very affordable and doesn't present the water scale problems that this machine has."

Coffee and coffee grinds go everywhere because the seal comes undone. I have to try to spoon out the coffee grinds in my cup, and clean up the mess afterwards.

Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer.<br /><br />The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.

No.  And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism.<br /><br />I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Amazon, too.  I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem.

I do not agree with another reviewer who says that they are ""just like Cheerios"".<br /><br />Sugar content-<br />They might have only 0.5g of sugar per serving, but compared with Cheerios this is still double the sugar (those have 1 in 28g). Not that Cheerios are the measure for all baby snacks, and they are certainly not organic, but they are at least not sweet tasting.<br /><br />Packaging-<br />You will receive a box with six plastic dispensers similar to the ones you get for wipes. Each container contains 2.1 oz (60 g) of rice puffs. The containers are so light you could think they are empty. The packaging is complete overkill.<br /><br />No wonder babies may like these- they taste sweet!"

Here's what we all pretty much agreed on:<br /><br />Visual:  Small but very attractive packaging.  Pretty much exactly what you might think a health potion would look like in real life based upon many popular games.  Smaller than expected--but then it more easily explains how your character in World of Warcraft, or 'toon, could carry 40 in one backpack.<br /><br />Taste:  Also explains why your 'toon refuses to drink another one for several minutes, even if it means dying.  Dying is preferable as long as you still have the aftertaste.  Think cough syrup, only without the benefit of alcohol or drugs.  Very glad it came in 50ml bottles--one good sized swig and it's gone.  After a short period of time, however, one starts to think it wasn't that bad.  An appropriate support group could probably help with that mild problem.<br /><br />Effects:  Works as advertised per friends who drank it (I drank the mana potion).  They were able to stay up as late as they desired, were able to concentrate well, and noted no adverse effects the next day.<br /><br />Active ingredients: Per their website, contains 25 calories per serving, includes Vitamin C (100% RDA), B1 (80% RDA), B5 (80% RDA), B6 (1600% RDA), B12 (100% RDA) as well as caffeine and enzymes.  Caffeine content roughly equivalent to two Red Bulls or four cups of coffee.<br /><br />Bottom line: Works well, but based upon the caffeine I would not recommend for children or anyone else you wouldn't hand a pot of coffee to and expect them to drink it all.  Really shouldn't be listed in toys and games, but rather with food or energy drinks."

Although, based on what some other reviewers said, it may be hard to find at local stores.  If a store offered this flavor in the past and no longer carries it... sad to say for the people who love this flavor... perhaps it didn't sell well.  It probably didn't appeal to the masses as the sensation and flavor is... unique.<br /><br />I was very interested in trying this flavor as I really like licorice and I love tea.  Upon taking my first sip, I thought the licorice flavor came through nice and the combination of spices was fine.  But then... seconds after my first sip, I got this really weird sensation on the sides of my tongue.  As if the flavor ""blossomed"" in my mouth.  And, to me, not in a pleasant way.  Another reviewer said the tea ""dances around the sides of your tongue.""  It does.  What's up with that?  That reviewer seemed to like the sensation.  I didn't like it at all.  It felt weird, it tasted weird and is making me cringe every time I take a sip.  I like the initial flavor, but I know the ""flavor burst"", or whatever you want to call it, is coming and it ruins the whole relaxing tea experience for me.  This is definitely not relaxing.<br /><br />The ""flavor burst"" is also followed by a sickly sweet after taste.  Ick.<br /><br />Most reviewers here love this tea, which I think is nice because I really wanted to like it too.  I'm surprised more people did not mention this unusual flavor thing going on.  Maybe it's an acquired taste sensation and I'm just not there yet.  So, buyer beware before stocking up on this flavor.  Definitely test it first if you can.  If anything, test it so you can see for yourself what I am talking about.  At least it's interesting... in a strange sort of way.  It's definitely not a tea I can drink regularly.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient list:  (contains NO true tea leaves)<br />Licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, Chinese star anise, vanilla flavor, sarsaparilla, orange oil, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil."

436720,B008O3G2GG,AID8OJP77VK6Y,Terry T,1,3,2,1338940800,Pros and cons...,"Pros: Very low-calorie; dogs love the stuff; good for them--nutritious, all-natural.<br /><br />Cons: Stinky; can be hard to get out; you have to stand there squeezing it the whole time (so giving a normal treat is far more convenient); messy. They inevitably drip all over, so you'd better use them over an easy-to-wipe floor, or outside.<br /><br />The way it usually works for me is:<br />*squeeze...squeeze...squeeze*<br />""Where is it?""<br />*liquid starts pouring out; lands on floor because it always comes out on the opposite side of the roller-ball from the dog*<br />With luck, the dogs don't step in it too much, and I can easily go over the area with a damp cloth after pointing out the spots for them to lick up.<br /><br />It's not as ""convenient"" as they'd have you believe. You don't just squeeze, let the dog lick the coated ball, and recap it. This is liquid, and it's going to make a mess and require cleanup. (To be fair, regular treats can leave behind crumbs, slimy goo, etc., as well.) You can travel with it, sure, but I would sure as heck NEVER use it inside my car. Your hands can obviously still contact the sticky end and require washing, and I never feel right screwing the cap back on without first rinsing and wiping off the sticky end. If you don't make a habit of doing this, I'm certain that eventually you'll wind up in a dripping, oozing, gooey predicament. This may be cleaner for your hands than pieces of something else that may be sticky, slimy, and/or odiferous, but it's hardly the neatest thing in the world.<br /><br />Also...""no delay in presenting?"" Hmm. There's typically more of a delay in waiting for the liquid to start dripping out, with the dog sniffing at it and waiting, than there is in fumbling with a treat bag in your pocket. Either way, they know what's coming to them, but speed is not really an advantage of this product.<br /><br />The very concept should make it excellent for training, especially, because that can run you through your allotted treats very quickly. Dogs really can lick as much of this stuff as they want at any given time...one lick is hardly ever enough, but always appreciated. I normally wind up squeezing every few seconds for about 30-45 seconds, maybe a minute or so. It makes a good diet snack because they get something very flavorful, less filling, and more healthful. However, it's so messy that you'd have to keep it somewhere nearby and out of reach during training, rather than inside your pocket.<br /><br />Of course, they put a positive spin on the necessity of standing there holding and squeezing the tube, saying that the administration of this treat provides a bonding time and reinforces to the dog the source of his/her treats. Well, okay. I can't call that untrue, although it is rather unnecessary for anyone whom has as strong a relationship with his/her dog(s) as I do with mine. And they are all definitely well aware of me as a provider (or slave, in the opinion of the dog with the catlike mindset.) You should see them make firm eye contact, then look back and forth from your face to the treat cabinet or room, pointing you in the desired direction! Don't get me wrong, though; it is usually pleasant to stay close to your pet, giving him/her continuous drops of scrumptious meat-flavored liquid as he/she focuses intently on that ball--instead of simply watching them snatch a traditional treat and devour it wherever they feel like at the moment.<br /><br />A marginal amount of bonding may occur while you hold onto this thing for a couple of minutes and the dog laps at the putrid-smelling goo, obviously mocking you for your deficient senses of smell and taste.<br /><br />I tried out the three-pack of liver, chicken, and bacon for my three dogs as stocking stuffers this past Christmas, and we've still got a little bit of bacon and liver left. They obviously last a decent amount of time. I wouldn't be averse to buying them again if I saw them at a fair price in a store, and was looking for a small-portion, different type of dog treat.<br /><br />I haven't used them yet as a ""distraction"" or ""soothing"" technique; I suppose this might work, although you'd clearly need someone else to administer the stick while you did the grooming or whatever you were trying to do. And I wouldn't necessarily expect a dog to keep still just because s/he was licking...not my nutters, anyway. But, it's an idea, at any rate. It might well be a good anxiety-reducing distraction. They do get pretty excited over it, so depending upon the situation, it just might have that power.<br /><br />Edit: I'm sorry, but I had to lower the rating to two stars. You're far better off dripping the tasty, low-calorie liquid onto a hard surface and letting the dog lick it up. It should be sold as a kibble gravy or something to pour into a tiny bowl, rather than as a ""Lickety Stick.""<br />These things really do just splatter all over the floor/ground whilst taller dogs lick SOME liquid from the ball, and shorter ones risk being hit with falling droplets. It's a good idea, but perhaps the substance needs to be thicker, or it needs to pour out neatly into a little tray, or something. Some dogs are better at catching it all before it falls, but height differences make it tricky to try and let two of them share one, if they're both willing. You can do one in each hand, sure, but of course that doubles the mess. The secret, really, is to squeeze slowly and gently, watch for where it starts to emerge, and rotate the ball so that the dog can lick it before it slides around the ball and falls.<br /><br />I somewhat doubt my likelihood to recommend or re-purchase Lickety Stiks, unless they come out with a particularly interesting new flavor, or improve the stuff itself. Furthermore, my dogs have actually begun shrinking away and ignoring them, obviously mistaking the sticks for their tubes of tooth-cleaning gel and spray--not the product's fault, naturally, but still a newly noted disadvantage worth mentioning."

My recommendation is that this is a great oil for cooking, and frying;fry an egg in Olive oil and you will never eat eggs another way again.  But if you want to make a simple greek salad for example, where olive and salt is the only dressing, you should go for the premium stuff that you'll find at your local gourmet food shop or in a meditteranean market.  My personal favorite (and yes I am biased because of my background) is Greek Olive oil from Messinia (southern peloponesus), but there are some varieties from Crete that are excellent as well.

We used a French Press which worked amazingly well but the pods won't work well in a standard coffee maker.  Our second issue was the lack of overall flavor.

This is a good value anyway, as I have seen tubs of conventional chewing gum cost more than this per 100 pcs. The only thing is, I can not tolerate the cinnamon flavor for some reason! I can eat cinnamon no problem in other foods, but this gum triggers canker sores for me. I keep forgetting that and order it now and then because I like cinnamon gum, but it's really a bad idea for me :("

284333,B0051COPH6,A2AWVROFGSZU4E,My Fake Name,0,6,3,1331337600,"Organic, Lie","***<br /><br />I ordered these bags of baby food in the expectation that a baby I personally know, seven-month-old Julius, would just pretty much lap them up, which would save his parents a fair amount on their food budget.  As it turns out, as the result of a long series of carefully measured, double-blind observations involving a large experimental sample size and of course a large control group, it has been ruled out that any explanation other than a constitutional aversion to spinach causes Julius to vomit.  Shortly after Julius eats spinach, he vomits.  Not just mostly but every single time.<br /><br />And I don't mean regular vomiting.  I mean what's called projectile vomiting, which you can look up, in which the vomitus can be exprelled WITHOUT WARNING at astonsihingly high rates of speed considering they're coming from a seven-month-old baby who can barely sit up yet without help.  Julius has ejected vomitus as far away as 10 feet at first burst, which is pretty impressive and a little dangerous if you happen to be leaning over him at the moment.<br /><br />As it turns out, his parents and the other people who take care of him DO have a preference whether Julius eats spinach.  Not surprisingly, they do NOT like it when their baby unexpectedly and at skin-stinging velocity pukes in their faces.  You might call them selfish to deprive him of spinach, but I don't.<br /><br />This product contains spinach in every bite, er, squoosh, so I am unable to test it in the field, on the ground, in real time going forward.  I can say that the fact no one fed Julius this product several times has saved exactly that many episodes of his unwanted projectile vomiting.  For this I add 1 star.<br /><br />However, I also did offer some of the Juicy Pear & Garden Greens version to my dog, PheyeG'hdeaux, and he refused after the first taste.  And this is a dog that will happily eat cat poop and long-dead squirrels.  For this I subtract 1 star, so we're back to 5.<br /><br />NOT A CHOKING HAZARD<br /><br />Up to a certain age, infants instinctively try not only to put things in their mouths but also to swallow them without regard to whether they are swallowable or even tasty.  Few seven-year-olds would try to swallow half a pair of dice, but Julius, at one-twelfth that age, isn't yet that smart.  If he tries to swallow an object of the wrong size and shape, it will get caught in his throat in such a way that his trachea, his breathing tube, is obstructed.  Julius will eventually exhibit gross symptoms of his respiratory distress -- his inability to breathe -- but that won't matter if no adult is looking.  If enough time goes by his brain will suffer anoxia, if enough more time goes by some of the neurons as well as other cells in that brain will perish, and if enough more time goes by Julius will be rendered unconcsious, and if the ultimate amount of time goes by he will die of asphyxiation.<br /><br />So it's important that the cap for this product not be swallowable by anyone with tastes as undiscriminating and survival instincts as undeveloped as seven-month old Julius's.  If it were the cap to the valve stem of the left front tire of your car, that would be one thing, or any of the other four tires, because the likelihood that cap will be reachable by your version of Julius is so low.  But the likelihood the cap to a pouch of baby food will be reachable by an infant is much higher.  The manufacturer has chosen a design for the cap that makes it all but impossible for Julius to swallow it or otherwise be harmed by it.  In fact, you may safely dip this cap in honey and dust it with sugar and hand it to him and walk away.  Or her.<br /><br />First, it's way too big for even an adult to swallow.  I took the opportunity of being in the same room with a pouch of this product and the family's well-known big-mouth.  I asked her to determine whether she could swallow it, and after explaining my reason I watched as she tried really hard for ten seconds or so and deemed it ""Not possible.""  The collar at its widest measures 1.257 inches.  The height is 0.628 inches, which as you probably know is equal to 0.009373 smoots.<br /><br />Second, the collar that surrounds the threaded part is mostly air, i.e., except for these four thin ribs or vanes, the collar is floating outside the threaded part, which means if the infant does manage to get it wedged at the top of the trachea where it enters the mouth, not only can air still pass through but any of the baby food itself can pass through.<br /><br />NOT NOT ORGANIC<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is a product that's referred to as organic.  The main ingredients -- pear, broccoli and spinach -- are ""organic,"" and it contains no preservatives unless you count ascorbic acid and organic lemon juice.  The problem, of course, is that without preservatives the product is more likely to spoil, to go bad.  And going on the assumption that foods labelled organic are more expensive to get from soil to spoon, the price of this product is surely higher than it would be otherwise.  For its being organic I subtract 1 star.<br /><br />EXTRA TESTING<br /><br />-- The goop, while it might be perfectly healthful for a baby, is a perfectly dreadful substitute for taco sauce, salad dressing, or the Alfredo sauce on a Parmesan-besprinkled bed of liguine.  Trust me.<br /><br />-- You might be wondering how well the goop inside, which does taste like pear and even kind of has the grit of pear, works as a substitute for, say, floor-tile mastic.  I laid four one-foot linoleum tiles in a quarter-inch bed of Baby Gourmet 1 Simple Purees 6 Months+ Organic Juicy Pear & Garden Greens, 4.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12) and waited a whole 24 hours, at the end of which time the tiles were not even remotely well-stuck to the subfloor but did attract a LOT of ants, so many that we needed the services of a professional exterminator, for which we will be suing Baby Gourmet for an amount in excess of $25,000.<br /><br />-- When you fire a Marlin .22 caliber rifle at the pouch from ten yards away, the bullet passes through quite readily and embeds itself in the right door of the 2012 Hyundai Sonata that is parked in the driveway of your neighbor three houses west, who will start out incredulous and end up irate.<br /><br />For these defects I subtract no stars, I just thought you should know.<br /><br />PRODUCT DESCRIPTION<br /><br />Finally, the Product Description on Amazon is comical.  It starts this way:<br /><br />""We think every mom has a morbid fear of feeding their babies vegetables . . .""  First, I find it sad that whoever wrote this decicded to say ""their babies"" when it should have been ""her babies.""  One thing we know for sure about anyone who's a mom is that that person is a female, so the excessive political correctness of not using the gender-specific pronoun here is also comical.<br /><br />But second, and more important, I find it incredible that the people at Baby Gourmet really believe ""every mom has a morbid fear"" of feeding vegetables to her baby.  Not just some moms, not just many moms, not even most moms, but EVERY mom.  That's just stupidly wrong.  And it's even wronger when you remember that it's a MORBID fear, one that is on a par with fearing death itself.  Whoever wrote this is telling us that the people at Baby Gourmet sincerely do believe that EVERY mom has a MORBID fear of feeding vegetables to her baby.  This is insultingly false, and it gives you permission to question everything else they say.  This is an example of offering for sale a solution to a problem that doesn't exist till the marketers create it.<br /><br />Also, I have to point out that the description goes on to say ""thus we have made a blend of Organic Pears, Organic Broccoli and Organic Spinach that taste well, out of this world actually!""<br /><br />For the comical mistakes in the Product Description I subtract no stars.  For the outrageous lie I subtract 1.<br /><br />Five stars plus 1 minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 am 3.<br /><br />***"

They were fairly tender and tasty but a bit chewy.  They are supposed to be ""hullless.""  I'm not sure I agree with that but it is true that the hulls don't pop off and land in the bottom of the bowl.  The hulls stick to the kernels which is what makes them sort of chewy.

The treats are liquid, contained in a tube with a roller ball at the top. The pet licks the ball and gets a measured dose, so to speak. But the problems begin right there.<br /><br />First, the two dogs (one medium, one large) both want to eat the tube rather than lick it, and getting the ""lick but don't bite"" idea across has proved a challenge. Second, you can give them one treat and then it seems the roller ball has to rotate to dispense the next treat. How do you do this? You can rotate the ball by hand, which is inconvenient and often messy. Or you can squeeze the tube and hope to get the pressure right and not spray the liquid on the ground.<br /><br />We plan on trying this as a leash training aid, a quick reward for proper behavior. The product seems ideal at least in theory for that purpose. Maybe we'll learn to use it better, but right now, it's a little more trouble than it's worth.<br /><br />By the way: We had three flavors.

First, they removed the handy green plastic strainer -- consumers are now supposed to be able to judge the exact amount of water that can be absorbed by the pasta or rice, aided by a lower water line in the container.  Second, in case you haven't read the fine print on the sauce containers, they have replaced the nice large chunks of white chicken meat with smaller, diced pieces of dark chicken meat.  I saved a few of the old green plastic strainers and they still fit the newer containers.

However, this soap foams quite a bit and goes really far - one dab will do you, as the old commercial used to say.  The soap is clean, fresh-smelling and works well.  The scent is not overpowering (my other fear about this product before I tried it)... it's subtle and quite nice.<br /><br />Now, for the only downside... the bottle.  The top of the bottle is curved so it's impossible to stand it on the other end. Why, might you ask, would you want to do that.  The bottom of the bottle is where the product comes out.  Picture yourself in the shower... you've just squeezed out some soap and you need both hands to lather up so you want to put it down MOMENTARILY.  If you could rest it on its top (which, since the product comes out on the bottom actually is like the bottom of a normal bottle), you could then easily access more product if you need it.  However, since you can't rest it on the top because the top is curved, you have to close the bottle, turn it upside down, and then put it down, three steps.  If you want more product, you have to pick it up and then open the bottle again.  Sounds like a small detail, but when you're late for work and just trying to get a quick shower, who wants all these acrobatics with a bottle?  Just poor design and not well-thought through but it's a new product on the market and I'm sure they will correct this going forward.<br /><br />I'm sure a marketing person somewhere ""pitched"" the top of the bottle as echoing the shape of the classic Dove soap bar (not to be confused with the chocolate Dove bar...)  and therefore suggested its curve.  Clearly they didn't actually take a shower with this bottle.<br /><br />In summary, excellent product, with packaging that needs a change.  Hope this is helpful!"

Kozmeaux (Shih tzu - Bijon frise mix), Gator (American Staffordshire terrier) & Grizzy (Husky-Chow mix). The larger dogs, Gator and Grizzy, will eat just about anything you will feed them, so it was no surprise when they enjoyed this dog food. The surprise came with Kozmeaux, who is a notoriously picky eater. He actually liked this food. So, this food passes the taste test.<br /><br />Next comes healthiness. Unfortunately, this food fails greatly in that area. It earns a 1 out of 5 stars from DogFoodAdvisor, with a large portion of its ingredients falling into the ""controversial"" category. Also, despite beef being listed as the first ingredient, it was found by analysis to contain only a ""modest amount of meat"", thus earning its one star rating."

We're generally not terribly adventurous with our coffee choices so we were more than happy to give Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee a try.

We used a French Press which worked really well.<br /><br />- Flavors may not be for everyone.<br /><br />Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee is a great concept but really fails to deliver on taste.  The first issue arises with the product being in pods.  Many people don't use pod machines.  We used a French Press which worked amazingly well but the pods won't work well in a standard coffee maker.  Our second issue was the lack of overall flavor.  As I mentioned earlier, the coffee taste was more like coffee flavored water than an actual brewed cup of coffee.  Despite the lack of taste, these pods are really handy if you travel or have a French Press at work.  If you're feeling adventurous or just want to support Organic and Fair Trade coffee growers then you may want to give Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee a try."

I actually prefer to liquid concentrated version, to be honest. But these are good for when I travel or when I'm on the go since you have to refrigerate the concentrate.<br /><br />Positives:<br />Works like crazy.

No bad side effects<br />Provides all natural energy from quercetin and high antioxidants<br />Quercetin is currently being studied by the FDA as a treatment for obesity. No results yet, but preliminary use of quercetin resulted in weight loss in many of its users which put it in the testing. (Google it...it's too long for me go into.) I shouldn't say you'll lose weight from it because of that...I have no clue. I swear it helps me but it could be coincidence that I have more energy which results in doing more, which results in weight loss. Who knows.<br />I know I need to drink it, but I hate water. I don't use a full packet of this in my water so that I get more ""water"" in my ratio, but it flavors it well so I suck it down.<br />I love the berry taste.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />This doesn't dissolve as well as other water flavorings. It often sticks to the side of my water bottle, or the bottom. Also, it can clump which means I'll suck in a tiny glob of it--this wouldn't be a problem if it were something like hot cocoa mix but the stuff has lots of vitamins in it so you suck in a clump and you get a tangy vitiman aftertaste<br />It's too expensive in my opinion for water powder. But I still buy it. It sucked me in.<br />I think the liquid concentrate is actually more potent but this works in a pinch when I'm on the go or to flavor my water since I am not a fan of water and flavorings are the only way I'll drink it.<br /><br />Conclusion: If they had competition on an all-natural Quercetin-full powdered drink mix, I'd shop it in hopes for better dissolving and a lower price...til then, I just use it sparingly and I use the FRS liquid low calorie concentrate as my ""go to"" healthy energizer every day (especially in the morn and prior to any workout).  I have that on automatic ordering through Amazon so it's actually 50% less than if I order it directly through FRS (I think the FRS site it a tad of a rip off for a few reasons) since it's 15% off that way and there is no shipping costs...that stuff is heavy if you order lots of bottles so it's worth it."

Plus, now that my son is getting old enough to start taking on some meal-preparation responsibilities, I've been keeping an eye out for meals he can make on his own. This one is certainly in his skill level!<br /><br />The instructions are easy enough to follow: brown some ground beef (not mentioned on the package: rinse it in a colander under hot water to reduce your meal's fat content then return to the pan); add 2 cups of water and the noodles from the box; bring to boil then cover and simmer until most of the liquid is gone; finally, stir in the cheese goop... er, sauce... and serve. Definitely something a pre-teen can handle!<br /><br />Our first impression: we were all surprised how Kraft managed to get the cheeseburger taste in there... straight down to the pickle flavor.

Harkleroad ""Tiffanys Bookshelf""",2,2,3,1312416000,I am on the fence...,"I was never much of a coffee drinker in college, and it was only when I moved out on my own, in graduate school, that I started to enjoy a good cup of coffee.  When I got my first real full time job, I would easily drink a pot of coffee every day.  However, as someone with a lot of gastrointestinal issues, coffee is a huge dietary sin.  The caffeine and acid could do me, and spur stomach aches that would last for days.  When I was officially diagnosed with acid reflux, my doctor told me to cut all caffeine out of my diet, cold turkey, until things were under control.<br /><br />Now that I have learned how to control my gastro issues, I am once again worshipping at the shrine of the coffee bean.  Since I began working again, I make a small pot daily.  But I quickly find myself feeling icky from drinking coffee.  So when I learned about Puroast Low Acid Coffee, I was thrilled.  It caters to people who have acid issues but love coffee.  I was thrilled to get to try it.<br /><br />My first impression was WOAH, this coffee is strong.  I am not a huge fan of french roast coffee, I tend to like a milder blend.  Once I got over the initial taste, and adjusted my milk and Splenda accordingly, I started to really enjoy this coffee.  While it was fresh and hot, it was pretty delicious.<br /><br />The problem with this coffee is when I returned to the pot for a second cup.  This was probably within 20-30 minutes of brewing, and the heating unit was still on.  But the coffee did not taste fresh at all; it almost tasted as if I had reheated coffee from yesterday.  It actually tasted more acidic that my normal coffee does.  So, I had to throw the rest of the pot out.  Because of this, I just cannot tell if this coffee really does allow someone with acid issues to enjoy a pot of coffee.<br /><br />Perhaps it was the french roast blend; another blend may have better results.  I would certainly try another flavor, because as I said, the initial cup was fantastic.  If this could be purchased as a resealable container, I may be more likely to purchase it, and make only a cup or two at a time, so as not to waste it.  I am not ready to give up on this product just yet."

Well, I guess I'm not Scottish. I've never regarded hot oatmeal as more than a cruel necessity of back-packing, and I've hated cold bran flakes -- honestly, all cold cereals -- since I was a child accustomed to Swedish cheese-and-herring breakfasts. But I'm adaptable. When I lived in Japan, I learned to 'relish' cold rice, raw egg, and dried seaweed for breakfast. It was easier in Spain, where hot chocolate and churros for dunking, in my neighborhood cafeter&iacute;a, seemed quite an elegant solution to the problem of mornings. Best of all was Italy: a huge bowl of caffe latte and a couple of croissants! But wait! Mexico was breakfast heaven: huevos rancheros, fried eggs on black beans and tortillas with melted cheese and hot sauce!<br /><br />Yes, I've had to confront the curse of mornings in a lot of environments, but now I'm living in the strangest realm of all: mortality, to which I hold the civic rights of senior citizenship. And I'm striving to be responsible, eating closer to my small share of the world's nutritional resources. Oat bran is reputed to reduce cholesterol - mine is unexpectedly high now - and to support a healthy colon. Well, a healthy colon is nothing to scoff at, in every way superior to a colon burdened with diverticula as labyrinthine as the intellectual diverticula of life in the USA.<br /><br />These Arrowhead Mills Oat Bran Flakes are 100% unsugared, unflavored, unadulterated horse food. I like that in a cereal to be eaten for duty rather than pleasure. Mixed with blueberries or raspberries, they're acceptably neutral, like the gesso on a painter's canvas before the pigments are applied. But you have to eat them quickly! Don't even try to read the sports page until you've gobbled them down! If they get soggy in the milk, they become as repulsive as canned spinach or truck-stop mashed potatoes.<br /><br />Are they effective for reducing cholesterol? I can't say. I bought my 'Pack of 4' and consumed my daily portion until the last box was empty, but that was probably not a long enough test trial to certify or decertify the product.

For at least 4 years I have been using the Green Mountain Columbian Fair Trade K-cups, been very happy with them. Recently I saw the Donut House flavor offered at my local warehouse club and it piqued my interest, problem is that the warehouse box contains 80 K-cups, didn't want to buy 80 of something I may not like. So, I picked up an 18-count box at my local Walmart, I'm so glad that I did!<br /><br />First, let me say that I'm not a fan of Starbucks coffee's, I think they are too strong, too bold, too bitter. I like a flavorful, medium roast but full-bodied cup of coffee. The Green Mountain Columbian Fair Trade K-cups fit this bill, whenever I would make a cup at my office, everyone would comment, ""Wow, that smells so good!"", it tasted just as good.<br /><br />I tried the Donut House coffee this morning, no inviting aroma when brewing, very bland in taste, I don't know how they get away with calling this ""Bold"".

Well, there was no after-taste, no taste period, just very bland!<br /><br />FYI, I usually use 16 oz. ""to go"" cups when brewing K-cups, I use 2 K-cups per 16 oz. cup, I brew the first K-cup on the middle button (8 oz. setting), the the second K-cup on the lowest setting (I think it is 6.5 oz. setting), this allows room for a teaspoon of sugar and some half and half to a golden color.

As both a scientist & a naturopath, I would like to promote some logical analysis into the mix.  Firstly, as you may remember from chemistry class, there are various types of sugars (e.g. glucose, sucrose, fructose).  Most naturopaths prefer fructose--which often comes from fruit.  However, fruit tends to be expensive so (to be competitive) manufacturers frequently use high fructose corn syrup--a concentrated product from corn.  Guess what?  Corn is just as natural as fruit is.  But then so are sugar cane and sugar beets--but the mix of sugars differs among sources.  So, what is important is the type of sugar (not the source) and (perhaps more importantly) the amount of it--since Americans tend (according to statistics) to eat far too much sugar (and salt and fats...).  Apparently this is a learned behavior as some experiments seem to indicate.  So, giving your kids lots of sodas to keep them happy is a short term approach creating a long term problem for them--not a great legacy.  True, this product evades the addition of artificial coloring, artificial flavoring, & preservatives--this is good.  It also includes acerola (a terrific source of vitamin C--look in your vitamins catalog and notice that some Vit C tablets advertise acerola as a plus for them).  But the can doesn't say how much acerola or Vit C--only that it meets the 100% recommended dosage.  This is essentially meaningless; it's the dosage to prevent scurvy--in the West today that likelihood is pretty remote.  Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling recommends 3000 to 5000 mg of Vit C daily--more than a case of Switch per day per person to achieve.  Of course, the scientific community has not accepted Pauling's argument--but then, to my knowledge, it's never been scientifically tested either.  It works for me though.<br /><br />TASTE & PACKAGING<br />As usual, the advertised flavor is not the main ingredient--usually it's apple or pear--here it's apple & grape.  Some people will tell you they taste them.  I don't.  I think they need to do a blind taste test--one's perceptions are mostly based on one's expectations.  I doubt they'd taste apple if they didn't know it had apple in it--but who knows?  Maybe they're budding professional tasters?  I found the black cherry taste reminds me of the old Franks' Black Cherry Sodas in big bottles delivered in wooded cases when I was a kid--though Switch's seems a bit strong to me.  But, of course, the case had to last all week--so we had to drink sparingly--unlike today.  You didn't drink from those bottles directly--as you did from the old green coca-cola bottles--which tasted better than aluminum or steel cans.  I find that I can sometimes taste the steel but not the aluminum from cans.  There's none from the can here.  Aluminum may be more expensive to use.  Both can be recycled (and are, where I live).  But, it actually costs more to recycle almost anything than to get new materials--so we have to pay the county MORE to recycle.  The one glaring exception is aluminum.  Aluminum yields a profit when you recycle it.  As far as I know (except for newspapers in bulk), it's the only material that does.  So I consider the use of aluminum a plus.  Of course, there is less aluminum because it's only an 8.3 oz can vs. the more common (in the US) 12 oz can.  This may seem strange in the States, but in Europe the smaller can is quite common.  Perhaps, it would encourage people to drink less of it--which would actually be a good thing because it's just not very healthy.  You'd be better off drinking water.  And, even bottled water is a lot cheaper per oz. than the almost $1 per can even if you buy a case with the Amazon $1 off/case discount.  So, if you buy it, drink it for the taste, not for its supposed health contribution."

I ordered this product anyway because it sounded really good from the description.  So, now that you know what perspective I'm coming from, let me describe my impression of this drink.<br /><br />Well, it's more like hot chocolate than coffee.  Seriously, my impression is that this tastes very little like coffee and much more like a Peppermint Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa.  That's fine with me, as since I mentioned earlier I don't really care that much for coffee.  So, really, what you've got here is ""latte"" that tastes like hot chocolate.<br /><br />There are some other issues I should mention, it's very pepperminty - in fact, it may be too strongly peppermint for some people's tastes.  The other issue is that it takes a TON of teaspoons of powder to make a normal average-sized mug.  I think I used like six on one mug.  That's not efficient at all compared to a normal-sized packet of hot chocolate.  Speaking of hot chocolate, since this tastes like hot chocolate, you really should just buy hot chocolate instead because it's a much cheaper, better value per ounce than this stuff.  So, given the things I've mentioned, I can't really recommend this ""latte"" drink mix to fans of coffee at all, or to fans of hot chocolate just based on price alone.

496978,B005HG9ET0,A2ZRQBRJIE7H0F,Dunyazad,1,1,3,1344988800,"Well, it doesn't work miracles","The product description for this bottled water makes various health claims: in addition to hydrating better than regular water, Essentia is supposed to boost the immune system, help maintain restful sleep and heart health, and so on. There are two justifications for these benefits: the increases electrolytes and the pH of 9.5.<br /><br />These health claims are the sort of thing that really need to be evaluated by scientific trials, not by individual experiences. But a bit of quick googling about ""alkaline water health benefits"" shows that the scientific literature is pretty thin. There seems to have been one study saying that alkaline water increases bone density, which is a good thing for people worrying about osteoporosis, and another study saying that it improved hydration. Meanwhile, various anecdotal sources say that it can reduce acid reflux, which seems particularly plausible just from a priori reasoning: if you're having problems with acid, you might be able to neutralize it by adding a base.<br /><br />I don't personally suffer from acid reflux, so I can't assess its effectiveness there, but if it's a problem that you do have, then it might be worth giving this water a try since you'll be able to see very quickly whether it works for you. The potential benefits against osteoporosis, on the other hand, are longer-term, so without seeing further scientific studies I wouldn't personally want to embark on a program of drinking expensive bottled water indefinitely, since it would be harder to judge whether it was actually working. The interest for me, then, was mainly in the improved hydration.<br /><br />I'm a casual runner, and I hate to carry water with me, so it's not uncommon for me to end up with a slight dehydration headache even after consuming water when I get home. That happened once this week already, when I went for a 5-mile run just after noon.<br /><br />I drank my 1.5 L sample of Essentia over two days (along with other fluids, of course). On the first day, I didn't run at all, but walked about four miles. On the second day, I went for two short runs, 1.8 miles each way to the bookstore and back in the middle of the afternoon. It was sunny out, so I felt pretty sweaty by the end of it. I drank Essentia before and after the run, though there wasn't much left by the end, and so I also drank about 750 mL of regular water as well.<br /><br />I didn't end up with a dehydration headache, and I also slept well that night, but there are too many other variables at play for me to attribute these good things purely to the Essentia. Maybe the difference from my previous run was the much shorter length, or the time of day, or just the overall quantity of water that I consumed afterwards, regardless of whether it was Essentia. While I'm intrigued with Essentia's claims, I'm not entirely convinced. I'd be willing to try drinking Essentia over a longer period of time if it were provided to me for free, but for the moment, the benefits aren't clear enough to me that I'm willing to purchase it in quantity for myself at more than $2/bottle. I'll await further studies.<br /><br />The one thing I can comment on with confidence is the taste, which seemed pretty average to me. There is something slightly different about it, but I find it hard to describe: it almost seemed reminiscent of carbonated water, except it's not carbonated at all. Anyway, the taste was fine, but I didn't find it unusually good; it was pretty clearly purified tap water (like Dasani), rather than spring water. The taste was better than Dasani, but not something that I'd pay extra for; I'm generally happy enough with the taste of tap water.<br /><br />So with an average taste and health benefits that could use some more research, this isn't something that I'm going to buy any time soon. Still, people with different health needs (particularly acid reflux) may find it helpful to them, and it will be interesting to see whether further research turns up any more relevant evidence."

While the almonds were a sweet and salty snack, these are salty and spicy.  As with the Almonds, the lid measures a 1/4 cup serving of nuts.  After eating these for a few days, here are my impressions.<br /><br />As you can tell from the headline, these didn't turn out to be quite what I was expecting.  Granulated onion is listed on the ingredients along with ""spices"", but the onion flavor comes through rather strongly with the salt and the pepper.  While the taste grew on my pretty quickly, I found that these made me very thirsty.  Compared to the 25 mg of sodium in the Cocoa Roast Almonds, these cashews clock in at 270 mg.  The almonds also win with 210 mg of potassium versus only 140 mg in the cashews.<br /><br />In the end, though, the taste is what is going to make or break this product for most people.  What you need to know is that the flavor of these cashews is very strong, and it doesn't come from the cashews themselves.  If a strong salt, pepper, and onion flavor is what you are looking for in a snack, this will be right up your alley.  For me personally, they are something that I wouldn't turn down if someone offered them to me.  However, I probably won't go out of my way to buy more of them.

It is the filling that I have a problem with; while it is tasty and very much blueberry flavored, there is nowhere near enough of it.  The picture on the box of the bar, including the filling, with the blueberry, is misleading.  All that would need to be done is to add between 25 to 50% more filling.  Sure, the calories would go up, but the additional filling would dramatically improve the cookie bar overall.

Dent ""Aragorn""",4,4,3,1304553600,Quality white tea with added unusual flavors,"Just in case, if anyone doesn't know what WHITE tea is, as opposed to green or black, let's quote Wikipedia: ""white tea is fast-dried, while green tea is roasted in an oven or pan (while kept moving for even curing). Oolong and black teas are fermented before curing."" What does it mean? For me, it translates into my favorite beverage to start the day with and to keep me going through the day. Objectively and scientifically speaking, white tea is said to have more anti-oxidants and less caffeine so, in my view, it's overall better than coffee or the black or green varieties.<br /><br />This particular product, while it comes in tea bags, it's not exactly your 'supermarket' variety. Unlike the cheap teas, black, green, herbal or white that are delivered crushed inside paper bags, the 'Choice' brand is delivered in pyramid shaped, biodegradable, nylon-like bags that ensure that what you get is actual leaves, not some indistinct crushed powder.<br /><br />This being a white tea, 'delicate' and 'subtle' and the required adjectives to use but they may not apply in this case. I found the added flowers to be a little too strong, bordering to overpowering for my taste. The Lychee and Osmanthus aromas can be an acquired taste - think of sweet, green apples for an equivalent more familiar aroma. If it's not 'love at the first sip', give it some time and you may not only tolerate it but prefer it to other flavors. Or not.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />- organic, fair trade certified White Tea<br />- natural Lychee flavor<br />- organic Osmanthus flavor<br />- contains caffeine<br /><br />The somewhat off-balance added flavors and the premium price are not likely to turn me into a repeat customer.

So when Wolfgang Puck's French roast turned up on Amazon's deal of the week, even though I have never tried before, now I have 48 units.<br /><br />It's fairly non-descript for a French roast.  Decent aroma, but taste is muted compared to, for example, a Diedrich French roast.  I don't hate or even dislike it, it's 'okay', and for the price I paid, is acceptable without complaint.  It may make an acceptable guest coffee for those wanting something a little bolder without being over the top rich.<br /><br />I'd call it mildly bold, average, and I won't be going out of my way to keep it on hand."

Parsley is an emmanogague and is the last ingredient on the list. Vitex can also mess up the cycles when they are normal.

For one thing, I think it's sort of impossible to grow a reasonable amount of each herb in such a tiny space under fluorescent lighting.  IF I grew this again (which I won't) there are certainly some things I'd do differently.  The manual advised not to thin the plants when they sprouted--mistake #1, especially for the basil--one basil took off and shaded the others, which were never able to catch up.  My purple basil and chives grew pathetically.  In fact, the entire time I grew this kit the chives had maybe four sad little stems.  Flavor left a little to be desired as well, especially for the dill.  Barely three months after planting, my herb garden virtually self-destructed.  This I blame on the fact that the company advises you to just keep throwing nutrient tablets in every two weeks, never rinsing out the bowl to keep the salts from becoming too concentrated/imbalanced.  Flushing the system is just basic maintenance with hydroponics!  In my bigger hydroponic garden, I have lettuces that are still going strong after four+ months, so there's no reason this should've burnt itself out so soon.  I think it's a bit of a deception on the part of Aerogrow; properly maintaining the garden would extend it's life greatly and you wouldn't be coming back to buy a new seed kit so soon.  But I was willing to let my herb garden go so I could try the cherry tomatoes.  So far so good with that kit, they are just now getting ready to bloom and I have high hopes for what seem to be very healthy looking tomato plants.  Next time though, I'll probably just buy the master gardener's kit, which gives you everything you need for one year's growth, except seeds, for $40.00.  I have amassed quite the seed collection, so I really don't need any more overpriced seed kits.  Plus, isn't it a lot more fun to experiment on your own instead of following the instructions in a manual?  Like I said, I love my Aerogarden, but sometimes it's a little too ""idiot proof.""  EDIT:  Having grown the tomatoes to completion, I can't recommend that kit either.  I didn't get very many tomatoes.  The ones I got tasted pretty much just like grocery store cherry 'matoes, so okay, but this was more of a novelty than an actual productive tomato garden.  Also, even though I pruned the plants at 5 weeks to make them stronger, they were in need of support.  I tried to tie them to the lamp arm as suggested in the manual, but the angle is all wrong; it doesn't help at all!  One of my plants fell over and died anyway, still loaded with it's meager crop of 8-10 underripe tomatoes.  I think you need more vertical space, a stronger light source, and some sort of growing medium to give tomatoes the support they need.  That said, I STILL LOVE THE AEROGARDEN!  It's cool, and I'm not giving up on it yet.  I just know it's perfect for something, but I haven't found the right plant yet."

(And if you're considering this food good enough for your own consumption, please note that the ingredient is also potentially toxic to human organs).<br /><br />Here's the list of ingredients, from the manufacturer's website:<br /><br />Fish broth<br />Tuna fillets<br />Yellow fin whole loin tuna/red snapper/shrimp/sole<br />Soy bean oil<br />Trialcium phosphate<br />Guar gum<br />Calcium sulfate<br />Carrageenan<br />Vitamins and Minerals<br />Vitamin E supplement<br />Vitamin A supplement<br />Vitamin D3 supplement<br />Zinc Sulfate<br />Thiamine Mononitrate<br />Manganese sulfate<br />Menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of vitamin K activity)<br />Riboflavin supplement<br />Folic acid<br />Pyridoxine hydrochloride<br />Copper amino acid complex<br />Iron amino acid complex<br /><br />First of all, it's great that the manufacturer has whole seafood as the major ingredients (as opposed to the by-products, meal, grains, etc). But there is one item which I would not have expected to find in something of this quality: Menadione sodium bisuifite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for the K vitamins and has been reported, at high doses, to have toxic effects. Moreover, I had actually never seen menadione listed as an ingredient in other cat foods (though there seem to be others out there).<br /><br />A little bit of Internet sleuthing yielded some disturbing information, which I feel obliged to list here.<br /><br />*Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />*There are safer alternatives to menadione for proper K vitamin-related functions (e.g. blood clotting). The use of menadione over the alternatives (leafy greens, kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food.<br /><br />*A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />*Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />There seems to be a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of menadione in pet food: [...]<br /><br />Does this information mean that this food is bad for our cats, when normal doses are given? I don't know for sure, but I wish that I'd been more aware about this ingredient before feeding it to my cats. Admittedly, more research needs to be done regarding this subject. In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I'm erring on the side of caution on this one."

The lack of strong fruit flavor in the tea, then, isn't too surprising.<br /><br />You can find the dragonfruit flavor if you look for it, but it's a subtle rounding influence that binds the herbs and spices of the tea together and is nearly lost under the stronger orange peel flavor.  The top notes are the ginger and other spices that make this tea almost an herbal ""chai remix,"" sans black tea.  Although there is no clove in the tea, the chicory and damiana do a good impersonation of it, but with a cost:  they impart more bitterness to the beverage.<br /><br />If you like chai and believe you would still like it without the nutmeg and other ""pumpkin pie spices,"" and if you like a bit of bitterness in your lightly and naturally sweet herbal tea, this could absolutely be your favorite tea.  It isn't mine, but there's no accounting for taste."

But I took a few more sips, I began to get used to it and like it a bit more. I could definitely taste the cherry in the drink and a hint of apple. Although, I'm not big on carbonated drinks that aren't soda. Also it may have a lot of pluses in what it doesn't put into your drink but if you're watching your calorie intake, The Switch Black Cherry has 130 calories and it's no different than what some soda and juice (like lemonade) have. It always seems slightly strange to me so I probably won't make a permanent switch to The Switch. The price of The Switch is another drawback.

Living in the Seattle area I was already familiar with illy for their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DYUI"">coffee beans</a> that are used in some of my favorite coffee houses. So being given the chance to try some of their canned coffee beverage was something I was looking forward to.<br /><br />After spending the night in the fridge, I opened the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY"">illy issimo Cappuccino</a> without shaking it as noted on the can and poured it into a glass. (*See customer images) The color was good with just a hint of dairy. The smell was nice too, but from that I could already detect the sweetness that I was about to taste.  The coffee was strong and smooth, but overpowered by the sugar.  After half the glass, I couldn't drink any more and offered the rest to my daughter who enjoyed it.<br /><br />Overall illy issimo has a great product, but like many canned coffee makers they overdo it on the sugar. I would much prefer the coffee be the focus of beverage with just a hint of sweetness if they feel the need to add it.<br /><br />*For those not interested in the overly sweet drinks like me, check out <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA"">illy issimo Caff&egrave;</a>. It's a much better option than the cappuccino version. Good flavor, but no dairy and not as sweet."

However, those of us who are sugar free drinkers, either by choice or necessity, thought this mix was on the upper side of good. It tastes very limey and *almost* like a margarita. It's a very good sugar free alternative. The color is VERY neon green. For me, it was a tad on the strong side. I think it could make 3-4 quarts (instead of the suggested 2 qt) with the same amount of mix and that is how I will try it next time. I also wonder if it would be better blended like a margarita.

It seems like it's about the chunky texture.  If I whirr this thru my little handy chopper for a few seconds, they finish it off pronto.<br /><br />The only negative is one in my own head... I get irritated with cat foods trumpeting ""grain free"" and then tossing in tapioca starch or potato starch... yeah, those aren't grains, but if a cat owner is looking to limit carbs to some extent, the ""grain free"" tag can be a little misinterpreted as ""low starch"".

The pasta is rice sized (forgotten the name of such) and the sauce reflects Kraft's mastery of cheeses.  The broccoli is minute but adds a worthy flavor and makes a plain chicken dinner into a filling repast with a creamy cheesy sauce that you really can't turn your nose up at.  I think for working Mom's it's a boon, but use two if you're feeding more than 3.  I don't like Hamburger Helper and I certainly don't like their chicken helper at all, but Kraft has made it palatable with a little extra pizzazz so I may have to go back and try other offerings now that I've discovered that some aren't half bad."

I understand that Sodastream sodas cant taste exactly like regular soda so im not expecting them to taste exact. With that said Im pretty pleased with or am OK with most of the flavors that ive tried. Bellow are my reviews of a few.<br /><br />Cola: 5/5 stars Doesnt taste exactly like Coke but is close. One of my favorites.<br /><br />Orange: 5/5 stars If youve tried different brands of Orange soda you will notice that some taste better than others. This tastes like cheaper dollar store orange soda, so is similar to Sunkist, but it still tastes pretty good & does taste like a known orange soda.<br /><br />Lemon Lime (Sprite): 4/5 Tastes like Sprite at first but leaves an odd after taste. Ive noticed that if you open your mouth after each drink the after taste is minimal. If it werent for the after taste I would give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Cranberry Raspberry: 5/5 Not sure what to compare it to, but it tastes great with no weird after flavor.<br /><br />Energy: 5/5 This came in the trial pack, & since im not into energy drinks I sipped it & had a friend try it. It gets 5 stars because it tastes just like Red Bull according to both of us.<br /><br />Dr. Pete: 3/5 Its OK but it tastes pretty vanillaish & not all that close to Dr. Pepper. You can sort of taste the similarity but not enough to say ""WOW! JUST like or very similar to Dr. Pepper!!!"".<br /><br />Overall Im still a big Sodastream fan, & most of the flavors ive tried I would buy again."

They are not made for use as ""teabags with coffee"" and they are not meant for Keuring machines.  If you put Keurig cup inside a regualar drip coffee maker, would you expect coffee to come out the other end?<br /><br />Now for those who have a Keurig machine and bought these, there is a solution.  If you have one of the cartridges that allow you to use loose coffee, for example <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI"">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>, then you can cut off one end of the pod and use the coffee.  This will give the product as intended.<br /><br />With that out of the way, let's turn to the product if you use it as intened or the ""Keurig workaround"" I illustrated above.<br /><br />Each pod comes individually foil wrapped for freshness.  When you open it, you are hit by the smell of strong coffee - perhaps even to the point of being pungent.  When brewed, however, it is strong but not overpowering and actually has a surprising sweetness to it one would not have expected from the aroma.  This is not a coffee that would appeal to those used to the mass produced variety or those who prefer a mild brew.  It is fairly strong and best savored rather than guzzled.

We use a 16 oz. cup because the circumference of the bag is rather wide for our 12 oz, and we pour boiling water over the bag which rises to the top as the cup fills. Then we wait for it to steep. After a couple of minutes, he takes a spoon and starts lowering it into the cup just until the bowl of the spoon is completely immersed. When the brew gets dark enough, the bowl of the spoon disappears except for the edges, and then it's done.<br /><br />It's a quality product, convenient, and can save on electricity, as well as not wasting coffee and good water, or adding pods to the landfill.

If you're looking for light, healthy-ish snack foods that are still tasty, this is a great choice.<br /><br />But there are a couple of problems:<br /><br />1.  The packets are very narrow and long, which makes it virtually impossible to reach into them to get the fruit out, once you're past the top third or so.<br /><br />2.  There's a decent amount of fruit dust inside -- which, as these are berries and cherries, is red, and just waiting for a bit of added water to  stain up any fabric it lands on.<br /><br />Either of these in isolation is no problem, but put them together, and you've got a product that you MUST pour out, and yet a product that you CAN'T pour out.  I guess maybe if you had a bowl or something, it wouldn't be a big deal, but that sort of takes away the portable-snack nature of it, no?  As much as I liked the fruit, the inconvenience of the packaging is going to keep me from buying more.<br /><br />Oh, and one more caveat:  Despite the ""Cherry Berry"" name, this is at least 50% apple.

They're too sickeningly sweet filled with tropical flavors built to give me heartburn. I love fresh pineapple, but when I wasn't on meds to help fight my acid reflux, even looking at one was enough to send me into heartburn agony for a few hours. But now I can indulge and it's wonderful! Anyway, yes, I don't like pina coladas because of the creaminess as well, so I'm glad they released a pineapple matcha as well as a pina colada matcha. Pineapple I can definitely get behind. We love pineapple in this house, my wife spent some time in Mexico and fell in love with them there. We even have one of those pineapple corer/slicers, a big piece of $10 equipment with a single purpose that I refuse to live without.  I am very excited to be trying this matcha and I'm praying it will help feed in to that pineapple addiction we've found ourselves with. Maybe I'll try it swirled together with some strawberry matcha...I love the taste of pineapples and strawberries together.  Or any of the berries, for that matter. They just balance each other out so beautifully.<br /><br />So after a bit of mental back and forth, I decided to give this one a go. Pineapple can be done well in teas, so hopefully this one will live up to expectations. When I first mixed it up, my wife could smell it from across the room. ""That has to be bubble gum or cotton candy."" Nope, just pineapple! It does smell very sweet. At first sip, I'd be hard-pressed to find pineapple specifically, more of an overall tropical candy flavor with a touch of a medicinal aftertaste, like chewable baby aspirin. But in the aftertaste, the taste that lingers on your tongue, I found pineapple. Yum, yum, yum pineapple. I'm not too sure of this one, I'm going to have to try it with strawberry, but it's got all of the sweetness of pineapple and none of the tartness that makes it so good. I don't think this is one I'll be stocking up on, but I don't think I'll be forcing it on my friends either. I won't have any trouble finishing it, but I doubt I'll get more. Still, I am grateful to have been granted the chance to try it! I just don't think I'm enough of a tropical fruit fan to fully enjoy it."

These are way more like the noodles you find in instant cup soups. And yes they did have an odor when first opened, but nothing terrible, and it was gone after a few min. of washing them in cold water.<br /><br />Some have said they can't work as a substitute in spaghetti, and maybe that's true if you're expecting an exact replica for a flour based pasta spaghetti dish, but I did try it, and I was happy with the results. I followed the advice of rinsing them then patting them dry, I did 2 packages of them at once. While that was going on, I was boiling water. I am a stickler for calorie counting and portion control nowadays, so I pre-measure and freeze most of what I eat. I had a measured portion of low cal. spaghetti sauce in a ziplock bag I was heating up in the water, but put it in too soon, as the bag broke and I ended up with spaghetti sauced water. So I made use of the accident to flavor the noodles. I boiled some pearl onions in the spaghetti sauced water, then added the noodles. Let that all cook for about 7min then heated up a second pouch of spaghetti sauce. I strained the noodles, put them in a bowl with the onions and now heated sauce and added some diced tomatoes and a couple shots of hot sauce. I wanted the tomatoes to cook a bit so I further nuked the lot for a few min in the microwave. Then topped it with a slice of fat free american cheese. It was actually pretty good. The noodles were on the chewy side, but not in a bad way. And they do soak up whatever you flavor them with. So as long as that part is good, the whole dish should be good. I think with these noodles anything spicy will work best. Which is why I added the hot sauce, something I wouldn't do with reg. pasta. I'll probably try a hot asian dish next.<br />But it's really nice to know I can eat twice the amount of the low cal/carb pasta I have been using which was 175cal a serving, and actually cut the calories of the dish down to basically just the 40cal in the sauce and 25 cal in the cheese!!!"

I have, of course, drank Starbucks coffee before, as well as Vanilla flavored coffees.  However, I have not had the two combined together into one coffee.  I can honestly say that I was not disappointed with Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored.  The package is incredibly well sealed and upon opening, the scent is mouth-watering and fresh.<br /><br />The amount used is the same as with any other coffee - 2 TBS per 6 oz of water.  This, of course, can be adjusted for each individual's preference.  The scent is heavenly, as the coffee is brewing and the taste is very robust and holds a light flavor of vanilla.  The vanilla flavoring is a very gentle and light taste, almost a whisper soft hint.  In addition, the taste is not bitter, but smooth and delicious.  I am one who drinks with a bit of sugar and cream, rather than straight black, as well as being rather picky on my coffee, as it bothers my stomach if it is overly acidic.  I had not problems, at all, with this particular coffee.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a full-bodied coffee with a slight hint of a vanilla taste.

I wanted my senior cat on this food because of its very low phosphorus levels which makes this easier for his failing kidneys to process. The moisture it provides once re-hydrated is also a huge bonus as cats by nature do not drink enough water (hence why dry food alone is so damaging to their systems).<br /><br />It took a few weeks of mixing my cat's favorite canned flavors to get him to eat this in larger portions. He still won't eat it on its own but my younger cat loves it (she is not picky). I typically mix up about 1 1/3 cups of the powder with 1 2/3 cups water which makes it a pretty soupy consistency. I store this in the refrigerator over night and it puffs up quite a bit more and becomes a lot more solid and lasts me about 2-3 days. I typically mix about 2 oz (or 2 spoon globs) Prowl to 1 oz of their beloved canned food (shredded chicken/gravy - also grain free) for each cat, each meal.<br /><br />This is one of the highest calorie good quality cat foods on the market only topped by their new cat flavor, Grace which is turkey-based making the Honest Kitchen foods more bang for your buck! I calculated it out and it is cheaper per month than exclusively feeding a canned diet. They also have a point program on their website when you save UPCs which can be put toward a free box (plus other goodies).<br /><br />Don't believe the myths that dry food helps clean teeth. That is like saying munching on pretzels or dry cereal cleans our teeth--you know how much gets stuck in all the little cracks! The only way to truly clean their teeth is to brush them just like people need to. The benefit of a moist food severely outweighs any misconceptions of what dry food does.<br /><br />Better yet! This food is minimally processed. Canned and dry foods go through intense high heat processing which basically slaughters and natural nutrients left in the foods, that is why there is a looooooong list of things you can't pronounce on the labels--they have to add it all back in. Looking at Prowl's label you will see that everything is REAL, WHOLE food and the dehydration process makes this raw meat safe from any contaminates you might be concerned about.<br /><br />There is a trial size available which has a great $5 off coupon on it... FYI! :)<br /><br />I chose to give this product 4/5 stars because I would prefer a product without large hunks of fruit and vegetable matter for my obligate carnivore. There is the occasional whole cranberry or hunk of zucchini/carrot once the food re-hydrates. The Grace flavor has a smoother consistency."

Soon the cookie was gone and I realized I wanted another one!  However, at 170 calories each, these are NOT ""low calorie"", they're just made with better ingredients than most.<br /><br />As for other nutrition information (other than the fiber and calorie count mentioned above), each cookie has 150 milligrams of sodium, so not too bad there.  You'll find 4% of calcium and 8% of iron (recommended daily requirements).<br /><br />The first ingredient is whole grain oat flour.  Sugar is about number 10 or so on the ingredient list.  One quibble I have is that the list of ingredients is rather lengthy.  My nutritionist has advised me to watch for products with what seem like extraordinarily long ingredient lists, probably means there's lots of stuff in there that's not exactly ""good"" for us, but it is what it is:  a factory-made, store-bought cookie that's got a pretty long list of ingredients and shelf life that don't come naturally to ""homemade cookies"".  Just accept it for what it is, a decent, convenient mass-produced cookie."

One of the dishes was macaroni and cheese, normally simple fare. My son loves mac and cheese, so I decided to try this recipe. One problem: It called for drizzling the final product with truffle oil. This was not something in my pantry.<br /><br />So, I checked out Amazon reviews of various Truffle Oil products. Most at some reasonable price feature olive oil, infused with a bit of truffle oil. Many of the products were negatively evaluated by reviewers. This tended to be responded to fairly positively. So, I took a shot and ordered a small bottle (3.5 ounces).<br /><br />And, boy, did it work out. It added a real richness to the final product. As a result, I am now more intrigued at the prospect of using truffle oil on recipes that might benefit (I just had a delightful dinner at Capital Grille, where French Fries were topped with parmesan cheese and truffle oil--quite tasty!).<br /><br />So, despite the reality that this is olive oil infused with truffle oil, it works well enough for me. . . ."

The backyard is where we grow vegetables and it has become our pocket gopher's heaven!  The mouse traps are pretty effective in catching mice in the front lawn.  But for the resident in our backyard, we've been outsmarted in more ways than one.  The gopher came out to munch on my plants at night and each morning I found another dead plant.  We've tried everything under the sun including a professional exterminator but all to no avail.  I wanted to get the Black Hole traps or Macabee traps but they were not available in this part of Canada.  I was about to throw in the towel when I saw this BlackBox.  I was very skeptical at first but I really didn't have anything to lose so I decided to battle the gopher one last time.<br /><br />I got two traps in a local store yesterday then came here to read the reviews.  Thanks to those reviewers who shared their experience in such detail that I was pretty confident when it came to to setting up my trap.<br /><br />I found a new mound and a new hole in our vegetable garden this morning, blood went straight to my head and I began to dig down like MAD.  I found a one-way tunnel that came from outside our fence.  I set one single trap there, following the directions of a couple of reviewers here (big thanks).  I covered the trap with loose leafs and a bit of dirt then I went to plug the mouse holes in the front lawn.  When I was still plugging holes I heard a ""thud"" and my heart jumped!  It was not even 30 minutes after the trap was set, could that be??<br /><br />When I got to the trap I found the trigger lever up and something was struggling inside the housing!  I didn't want to pull it up immediately hoping the rodent would die in a few minutes.  Unfortunately the spring was not strong enough to kill the gopher at first snap.  To me, digging the tunnel was work, setting the trap was easy, but killing the gopher was difficult.  But I really had no choice.  If I let that thing go it would come back and tear up the rest of our garden.  So it got to die!<br /><br />The pocket gopher was not very big, about 6.5"" in length tail not included.  It got tiny eyes and very long teeth and claws.  The gopher got cheek pouches to store food and there was still a bit of green left in one of its cheeks when it was killed.<br /><br />Since the tunnel came from outside our fence I reset the trap just in case someone else decides to move in.  Overall I am very happy with this trap.  The design is simple but this little trap performs better than those exterminators come with big price tags.<br /><br />My only complaint about this trap is the instruction, or the lack of it.  There is a  brief instruction printed on the box without details.  If Victor could provide one single sheet with printed diagrams to go with written instructions that would be nice.<br /><br />This trap is pretty safe to use and there's very little chance to catch a finger inside the housing.  However, once the trap is set you must be very careful when moving it around. One of my traps is more sensitive than the other. The first time I set up the sensitive trap and tried to move it inside the tunnel, I was not paying attention and the spring was trigger.  The metal lever sprang up and hit my ring finger! Fortunately nothing was broken, just a big bruise.  I have uploaded a few pictures of the captured gopher.  Revenge is sweet!<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with this product.  This trap definitely deserves 4.5 stars!"

We are big consumers of squeezeable pouches in this family because they are easy, fast, and nutritious. They are much healthier than giving a bag of some over-processed carbohydrate snack. If I'm in a hurry, which is always, I grab a few of these for the diaper bag and use them as on the go snacks. My daughter, 2, loves this new apple and oats flavor. I'm really happy to see grains incorporated into these new flavors to make them a little heartier and to help offset the effects of a diet with too much fruit. The fact that there is quinoa added as well is even better. This means a little boost of protein and a really, really healthy and slow digesting grain (all good things to add to a healthy diet). My only complaint is that the pouches are tiny at 3.17 ounces. My daughter can a eat few of these in one sitting. Most toddler geared pouches that I buy are 4.4 ounches, which seems more appropriate for a toddler-sized appetite. It seems silly to me that these are made so small. This small size is better for baby food, not toddler food. Oh well! Maybe Plum will change this in the future."

It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are ""100 Calorie Packs"", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight.

Still, you are told not to steep green tea for more than a couple minutes or else the bitter flavor comes out.  So, with matcha it's just gonna happen, since you can't take out the tea bag.<br /><br />That said, the Japan matcha was more granular than a ""powder"", more like sand really, and did not produce much bitterness even after ten minutes in hot water.  This Taiwan tea by comparison is a true powder.  It is difficult to dissolve, clumping a quite a bit, and produces a flavor that within a few minutes in hot water becomes bitter, then later even more bitter.<br /><br />UPDATE: It turns out you use a lot less of it than you do of the Japanese matcha I had.  The powder, since it is so fine, goes much further.  To help you with this, they have a spoon in the box to right-size the servings.  I was using a much larger teaspoon instead previously.  Using the smaller amount, it works great for hot tea and does not become bitter."

Some of them are a bit off, and some of them are really good, so I decided to try 'Asian' and was delighted.  Wasn't sure what I was expecting, but the taste is very much like soy sauce with a slightly thicker consistency.  I love to pour it over chicken or fish and then pop it in the oven.  The only downsides have nothing to do with the quality/taste.  1, Sodium.  This is to be expected with most salad dressings.  If you eat it in moderation it shouldn't be an issue, but since it's zero calorie, some people think it's ok to pile it on.  This isn't the case.  2, Price.  The price tag might turn off the average consumer, but for me it's a trade off for the taste that I love and the zero calories/zero sugar advantages.<br /><br />If you're curious, and just want to try it out, I say go for it.

In order to prove or disprove that, I would have to hire a team of scientists and do expensive and exhaustive tests on myself. I'm not going to do that!<br /><br />What I can tell you is that I have well water and it is extremely high in iron and has to have a softener added to make the water palatable. My problem with that is that I'm on a low salt diet for a heart condition so I now have to double filter my drinking water. It's filtered once at the beginning of the well and again in a separate filter in my fridge.<br />This is some of the info from the Essentia web site, and the product description from here- ""Drinking Essentia Water helps bring you back into balance and helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more. Plus, Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system.""<br /><br />I have to admit that I did drink a whole bottle of this for the last few days---and I have been sleeping better (Can't tell you if it's a coincidence). IF the claims of lowering blood pressure and heart health are true that will be a plus for me, but right now as I said only long-term usage and the help of my doctor will tell me if the claims are true.<br /><br />It tastes better than my well water and actually, it does have a `smooth' sort of taste to it. Of course, since it's bottled it is convenient to tote around and to keep some in my car too.<br /><br />The problem is, is that I'm not so sure if it is worth $2.40 a bottle without the subscription with the subscription it comes to $2.04 a bottle. If you drink the amount of water Doctors recommend, that will come to approximately 300.00 a month (much more if you want to use this water to make your coffee tea etc. for added health benefits ). In addition, having to haul a heavy case of water up the stairs a few times a month does not turn me on."

It takes her about 40 minutes to get a cup of kibble from it.  It is great for her mentally and physically.  It has also been a tremendous help to her digestion, as she was a ""competive eater"" when we adopted her, always wolfing down her food in seconds, and as a result having ""intestinal turbulence"" with alarming frequency.  The tug a jug forces her to eat slowly.  It took her a while to get the hang of it, so it was a supplement, not a substitute, for her regular meals at first.  But now that she knows how it works, I usually feed her one of her two meals in it each day.  The other day, I actually split her dinner between the food bowl and the tug a jug, and she opted to play with the tug a jug for 25 minutes before going for the ""easy meal"" in her bowl.  I can't think of a better endorsement than that!  The one drawback is that it breaks down somewhat easily.  We are on our third tug a jug.  Each previous one has lasted about a month before our dog has bent the end the food goes in enough that it can't be closed anymore.  So, we buy three at a time now.

How does it stack up?<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- Flavor is nice... mild but 'refreshing' when chilled<br />- 81mg of caffeine provide a nice boost<br />- 100 calories mean you can drink this without feeling guilty<br />- no preservatives, natural coffee flavor, etc. add another layer of 'guilt-free' to this product<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- price point really isn't a savings over just snagging other coffee drinks at the gas station or grocery store<br /><br />SUMMARY: if you drink coffee regularly but would like the option for 'quick' canned coffee drinks like this if you are in a rush sometimes, this is a good product for you.

The back of the box prominently promotes 20g of whole grain per serving, no hydrogenated oils, no high fructose corn syrup, no artificial preservatives, no flavors, no colors.<br /><br />The Nutrition Facts label is confused - it makes you pause and think in order to figure out what exactly a serving is. So let me reset it - the box includes three sealed wrappers with seven cracker-sheets each. The serving size mentioned on the box is two cracker sheets. Each cracker sheet, based on the pictures on the box, is supposed to have perforations so you can break it into four smaller crackers. That's where the serving size of 8 crackers comes from. None of the cracker sheets I got had any visible perforations like the ones in the pictures. Not an issue for me, but if you need a smaller serving size, or perhaps for a party or an event, do take that into consideration. Nutrition-wise, they have 2g of fiber and 2g of protein per serving, 7g of sugars, and 130mg of sodium (5% RDA).<br /><br />[...]<br />To summarize, these exceeded my expectations in terms of taste.

The chocolate seemed to be on the darker side even though it was labeled ""sweet"" on the ingredients list.<br /><br />However, these 18 cookies also came broken and damaged from their shipment via Amazon.  Several were simply separated into bottom graham section and top marshmallow section, it was so obvious through the unopened clear plastic.  Several also had signs of fat bloom which happens when chocolate is not stored under proper temperatures; it looks like a discolored section, generally much lighter than other chocolate.  A lot of folks say it doesn't taste different but I think it has a slight grainy texture and a less cocoa flavor.<br /><br />If you like marshmallows, graham cookies, and chocolate, you should check these out but only if you buy them in a store you know will house them properly until you get them.  At that point it will be up to you to prevent either fat or sugar bloom."

The second type is the  more liquidy type that you can spoon, almost pour into the cats plate.

Like the guys in R&D accidentally filled some roll-on deodorant tubes with dog food flavoring.  Or maybe it was a large-scale Big Lots-style buy where the guys at the pet food factory got an incredibly great deal when a Ban roll-on factory got flooded and had to unload a warehouse.<br /><br />In any event, what seems like a really weird idea is...well, a really weird idea that our dog LOVES.  Of course there's not much nutritional value to letting your dog take a few slurps off the end of a liver-flavored roll-on doggie treat, but hey, there's not much nutritional value to that rawhide toy you just bought him either.  Give this a try for dessert."

She said she noticed when she drank this it did not give her tons of energy but she remembered everything she needed to do with her patients in clinical and to her that was great. Overall she was impressed with this product. She is slightly ADD so to hear that from her it is worth it. So for gift giving this is great. Not something I can continue to keep in stock for her because the cost is a litle much but again for gifts it is nice.

The size of the product does seem to convey this. At 8.3 oz, this is something a lot of people could finish in one or two gulps.<br /><br />The flavor is nice and tasty. You can taste both the berry and kiwi.  No funny aftertaste and it goes down easily.  It is not tart nor is it too sweet. The carbonation isn't too overpowering. It's not as strong as a soda but it's not on it's last fizzy breath either.  I could see the bubbles disappearing faster than soda after sitting out for a while.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say this is a nice alternative to your average soda/juice box.  It'd be perfect for kids to drink in school.  My only suggestion is to make the can a little bigger as there's just not enough juice to completely quench your thirst for the price that you are paying."

I use the Yogourmet incubator too - a gift from my mother when I got married 12 years ago. The gift that keeps on giving is always the best! I have tried all of the Yogourmet freeze dried starters with fantastic success. The Yogourmet Casei Bifidus Acidophilus Probiotic Yogurt Starter, is my favorite, found here on Amazon for a GREAT price. Due to the higher price though, I tend to use the original freeze dried starter the most. I give this company a 100% positive review. I have never had problems with any of their culture products or with the Yogourmet incubator machine.<br /><br />I use 2 quarts of milk with the recommended 10 grams of Yogourmet starter. I have found for myself, that the key to making great yogurt is to heat the milk to 185 degrees and continue cooking it at this temperature for 10 minutes. Cooking at this temperature kills any harmful bacteria in the milk that remains even after pasteurization. It also breaks down the proteins in the milk insuring a great yogurt SET. Apparently, the proteins are easier for your body to digest in this broken down state as well. Cool the 2 quarts of milk to 112 degrees, add starter, (10 grams freeze dried starter or 1/2 cup leftover yogurt from original batch) 1 1/2 cups optional powdered milk, up to 1 cup optional sugar and up to 1 tablespoon optional flavoring extracts. Incubate until desired tartness is reached. My kids prefer the maximum sugar so the yogurt tastes more like store bought. Although with this much sugar, the milk takes longer to turn into yogurt - closer to 8/9 hours rather than 4/6 hours. Try using honey extract, vanilla extract, raspberry extract, etc."

74220,B000H23ZF8,A2LIACDMOYX9X9,Maxwell Platoff,0,0,5,1278979200,Best Noodle Mix Out There,"I will start by being forthright about the negative aspects of this product. Mainly, that the noodles and sauce in Sapporo Ichiban's Yakisoba Chow Mein noodle pack are full of monosodium glutamate, a chemical ""flavor enhancer"" often found in Asian restaurants and store-bought Asian cuisine. The numerous studies done on the ingredient, however, have only yielded inconclusive results about the negative effects that MSG has on the body. The rule I follow is to try to consume all things in moderation. Although these are delicious, I prevent myself from overindulging for the sake of my own health.<br /><br />That said, these noodles are some of the best I have ever tasted and hardly have any majorly different ingredients from other mainstream noodle packs anyway. The seaweed packet goes great with everything else, and the predominant benefit for me is that THESE ARE VEGAN. For those of us who get depressed wandering through the ethnic food section of supermarkets searching through products with oyster and fish sauce and beef and chicken broth, this is the way to go. I like to fry some tofu and vegetables in a saut&eacute;e pan before adding the noodles and it is SO GOOD. These are certainly not the most authentic noodles that you will find out in the world, but they are quick and filling and VERY SATISFYING and also CHEAP. It's hard for me to imagine a better deal."

The recipe is different than the standard chile favored by Americans because it has spices such as cinnamon and cloves.  Of course out of a can, it is not the same as in the restaurant (I still favor the one off Oakley Square when I go back to Cincinnati).  The frozen doesn't ship well so we are left with the canned as our only choice if there is  no franchise nearby.<br /><br />My main problem with the canned chili is it is too watery.  Either cook it down a bit or strain before serving.<br /><br />Here are the typical recipes:<br /><br />Pour chili over a plate of freshly cooked spaghetti.  Add a VERY generous amount of shredded cheddar cheese (mild is favored).  This is a three way.  For a four way, add diced oniions.  Five way?  Red kidney beans.<br /><br />Take a hot dog bun and apply yellow mustard.  Use a good quality beef hot dog.  Pour chili over it, sprinkle some diced onions and add a VERY generous amount of shredded chedda.

When I made him a grilled cheese he said it ""tastes just like a real grilled cheese!""  It has a great taste and NO BITTER AFTERTASTE as is commonly the case with other gluten free breads we've tried.  Unfortunately, it is much more expensive(about $2.50 more when buying a single loaf)than the Udi's Gluten Free White Bread we usually buy at our local grocer BUT, in its defense, the loaf is much bigger than an Udi's Gluten Free White Bread loaf (my son calls Udi's toy food sized bread).  A slice of this Little Aussie Bakery White Bread is the closest in size to a regular slice of bread that we have found since he got sick.  I wish we lived in San Antonio because I would love to be able to buy him this bread exclusively but with the expensive price per loaf and expensive shipping ($9.99 for 1 loaf) we just can't afford it:("

My kids think it tastes great so it's nice that we can actually eat pizza again.  The dough mixes up and rolls out easily.  I also don't have problems with it sticking to the rolling pin or pan like some of the other mixes I've used. It's best to follow the instructions exactly the first time, then adjust accordingly.  I made the mistake of baking the crust early in the day, then adding toppings in the evening.  It was like eating pizza on a cracker!  I also find I have to add a lot more milk than the mix recommends to get the dough to stick into a ball shape, so don't be surprised.  Also, when reheating it turns out much better to bake for 10 minutes in the oven than to microwave your leftovers."

It's more expensive, but very very good, with real salmon flavor and texture. It truly is skinless and boneless, and in nice big chunks (it's like a big piece of fish in the can, with maybe some smaller chunks to fill the space and weight needs). And being wild-caught, and in BPA-free cans, there's the added assurance that they're good for you!<br /><br />This would be excellent in a salmon salad, but what I do with it most often is a salmon hash, with sweet potatoes. It's also good mixed into mac & cheese! For those of us who don't have regular reliable sources of fresh wild sockeye this is really a great option.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE: after the comment here I did further research, and the cans for the salmon are NOT, as of mid-2012, BPA-free (the tuna and sardines are). Sorry for the misinformation; I had seen reports that all of the Wild Planet seafood was BPA-free, but apparently (according to the company) there are no Alaska plants working with BPA-free cans and their other tests to date have not been satisfactory.<br /><br />Since it's an occasional rather than everyday for me, and the quality is otherwise so high, I'll keep using this. But others should make their own decisions."

Here is my favourite (start the clock): put on some basmati rice. In a separate pot, steam a large chopped onion for a few minutes. Add one can of lentils (always with the liquid!). Add dried garlic bits, chili powder, ginger powder, curry powder, all to taste. Stew for a few minutes. Add garam masala (a spice that can be purchased in most grocery stores) and cook for another few minutes. Serve over the basmati rice. There! Stop the clock! This should not have taken more then 20 minutes. Makes two servings (unless you are very hungry). This can be also prepared using oil (you'd fry the onion, instead of steaming it). The taste of the dish can be manipulated by using other spices (turmeric, cumin, etc.) and adding other vegetables (peas, tomatoes, cauliflower, etc.). You can also try adding some sliced almonds and a few raisins. You can prepare this a day ahead and take to work with you for an inexpensive, but tasty and healthy work lunch! The cost of the meal, including rice and the entire can of lentils, comes to less then four dollars (or thereabout).<br />4) These lentils are organic, vegetarian, and kosher, for those who are interested.<br /><br />PS: Do not be put off by the ""funny"" look of the lentil liquid once you have opened the can. It is supposed to look like this. DO NOT drain the lentils!<br /><br />Enjoy!"

521491,B007JFXWRC,A23WE2XLY1MROA,Houston,0,0,5,1349913600,Sachets make excellent tea,"The flavor of Lipton's Herbal Blckberry Vanilla tea is not unique, (I've tasted other similar berry/vanilla combinations before), but it is still delicious. Strong without being bitter or tart, it is enjoyable both hot and cold. And, importantly to those of us who think tea cups can never be too large, it is powerful enough to make one very large cup, or two normal sized cups.<br /><br />Some of the flavor can likely be credited to the sachets that the tea is packaged in. Triangle shaped tea bags made out of a silken material, they have been used for years by fine tea producers, (and are not unique to Lipton, no matter their claims). They are a compromise between using loose tea and traditional tea bags. Loose tea is made with larger leaves/herbals, because they are able to spread through the water and infuse easily. Traditional tea bags are made with smaller pieces because they have less surface area that can be exposed, limiting their ability to infuse the water, and resulting in a ""brisker""/sharper flavor. Sachets are a compromise between the two; the leaves/herbals are larger, resulting in less briskness, i.e. better flavor, but you still have the ease of use of a tea bag.<br /><br />Even if Blackberry Vanilla isn't for you, Lipton has got the sachets right, and I would recommend trying another in the line to see what a difference it makes to the flavor."

42591,B006C6S3QY,A191NJEU1NDZZ0,R. L. Ayers,0,0,5,1349740800,Like crack.  Only good for you.,"I've been experimenting with homemade sugar-free chocolate for a while now, and after trying a large number of sugar substitutes, I've found it very difficult to make anything that I'm proud of.  Chocolate, in general, is very temperamental.  It has six different crystalline forms, and you have to get the temperature just right or else you wind up with a less than desirable form.  And your sugar substitute needs to be fat-soluble and anhydrous, because small amounts of water can will cause your chocolate to seize.  It's very complicated, and I've never been keen on anything I've made myself.<br /><br />Coco Polo's chocolate, by contrast, is tempered perfectly.  It has just the right snap and mouth-feel.  Because it's flavored with Stevia and Erythritol (the easiest-on-your-stomach sugar alcohol), you can eat the whole bar in one sitting and not suffer any unpleasant effects.  At least I didn't.  Everyone is different.  But I can say that even small amounts of malitol-sweetened chocolate cause me gastric upset.<br /><br />That being said, this product is not as sweet as ordinary sugared chocolate.  But that is going to be true of any sugar-free chocolate.  In particular, Coco Polo's sweetness is also somehow more subtle, which is the best I can explain it.  If your familiar with Stevia as a sweetener in tea and coffee, you'll know what I'm talking about.  It's not as intense as sugar, but it's still nice and doesn't have any chemical aftertaste.  If you are a fan of less sweet dark-style chocolates, than transitioning to this sugar free band is easy.<br /><br />If I didn't know any better I would give this product 3 or 4 stars because it is not as good as regular chocolate.  But having tried to make my own for years, I recognize when I've been outdone and I'm giving it a 5 star review.  I've also tried many brands of sugar free chocolate over the years, and I like this one the best.<br /><br />On the downside, I think this chocolate is too pricey.  When I ordered mine, it was shipped in an insulated container with cold packs to keep it stable.  This was in the spring and early fall - perhaps in the winter they forgo this treatment.  (They don't ship at all in the heat of summer.)  So perhaps the extra cost is to cover the special shipping."

The Lavazza crema e gusto ground coffee works perfectly in this pot, only takes a few minutes to brew and the taste is wonderful, full bodied, rich and with no bitterness. For me, it lingers with a bit of smokiness and overtone of dark chocolate.

Whatever brand I have tried, Intelligentsia surpasses it.<br /><br />Once you taste Intelligentsia coffee of any kind, it is hard to go back to other brands.<br /><br />The best reason to try Intelligentsia is their commitment to direct trade. They travel all over the world to interact and do business with small coffee farms. Intelligentsia pays growers 25 percent above the Fair Trade price. They have written contracts directly with these small farmers in these nations, and you can see photos of these farmers on their website on the pages of the coffee you are purchasing.<br /><br />Intelligentsia Coffee defines Direct Trade in 34 words: ""Roaster and farmer collaborating in a meaningful and mutually beneficial way to create great tasting coffees which are fully traceable, highly differentiated, and definitively sustainable as measured by current social, economic and environmental indicators.""<br /><br />There are videos by the folks that started Intelligentsia that explain Intelligentsia Coffee's company philosophy better; you can google for them. What Intelligentsia has done for the coffee trade is simply amazing and awe-inspiring.<br /><br />And it doesn't hurt that their coffee tastes absolutely delicious. Once you see all the steps that go into it, it is easy to understand why. Farmers revisit the coffee fields many times during the growing season, which lasts several months, to pick only the ripe berries. This is more labor-intensive: more picking requires that the laborers be paid more. It also results in better beans.<br /><br />I tip my hat to them: they have changed coffee as we know it. I find that now, when I shop for coffee, I ask more questions and do more label reading when I shop for coffee rather than just purchasing a bag. Intelligentsia is the first coffee company that taught me some personal accountability for what is in my coffee cup."

I know it has soybeans and I was concerned about that particular ingredient and I emailed the company, and I feel so much better after their reply and doing the research myself. I definitely will keep her on this food, she seems to be doing very well on it.<br />Here is the reply from the company : Thank you for your question. I can understand why you ask as soybean has gotten something of a bad name but it is actually a very good protein source that compliments other proteins. Organic soybean contains a complete complement of amino acids, naturally complexed vitamins and chelated minerals; balanced and stabilized fatty acids; and lecithin which is an important brain and nerve component and helps increase immune response. The main concern people have is the possibility of digestive problems, this is mitigated in the cooking process, increasing the protein digestibility and helping reduce flatulence.<br /><br />This is about the ingredient poultry meal:The ingredient for the ORGANIX® Grain-Free formula states poultry meal, rather than chicken meal due to the organic certification regulations. The ORGANIX Grain-Free food is actually formulated with chicken meal, which is of the same high quality as our chicken meal in all of our ORGANIX diets.<br />Our product is certified in the ""made with organic"" category and there are specific regulations about how to label or communicate to the customer which ingredients are organic.  We are allowed to list 3 specific organic ingredients or organic food groupings in the ""made with organic"" statement.  This is why the front of our bags call-out ""made with organic chicken, peas, flaxseed"". Part of the regulations also require that if the organic ingredient is a call-out on the packaging that all ingredients in that category are organic.<br />Since our packaging references ""made with organic chicken"", it is required that all chicken ingredients in the ingredient dec are organic.  This seems like a simple problem to solve.  Just use organic chicken meal.  The problem is organic chicken meal does not currently exist.  There are multiple reasons why it is not available, but the main point is we cannot purchase organic chicken meal, yet our formulas were formulated to contain chicken meal in order to provide a wholesome balanced nutrition for our pets.  This is why chicken meal is listed as poultry meal in ORGANIX Grain-Free."

But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor.

I took some aggressive steps to adjust my diet and to start exercising more, and began taking phytosterols.  But I came across many reports that warned how sterols passed through the colon and could accumulate in the arteries much like cholesterol.  Stanols, on the other hand, are not absorbed in the colon, yet provided the same protection from cholesterol.  So I switched to Benecol.  I used their margarine because the Chews weren't available since March, but it looks like they finally started stocking the Chews again.  FYI, my last checkup showed a 20% drop in total cholesterol, and my HDL/total ratio is up to 4:1, which my doctor said is good.  I'm hoping my next checkup will be even better.<br /><br />BTW, be careful of misinformation from reviewers.  Sterols and stanols are not the same, and the literature bears this fact out.

How, may you ask, can simple gummi candy differentiate itself from one another? After all - all gummi candies taste relatively the same, like processed sugar, corn syrup, and chemical colouring. But that is precisely where the discerning synaesthete draws their inspiration! For whilst normal gummi-flavored candy products have a boring range of flavors (chemical red, chemical yellow, and chemical green), the Gummi Octopi not only dual-wield vibrant and bright colors yet unknown to most other brands of candy, their taste is simply divine! Ah! Ice-tentacle blue, and beryl yellow! The sweet satisfaction you provide!<br /><br />In addition to that and the product's proper status as Gummi Octopi, as noted by my fellow reviewer f. ferreiro, my other fellow reviewer - Brook Lindquist - raises and equivalid point. The cuteness of the product can not be understated! Each individual octopus has two little eye-bumps and a smile carved into their trusting frame, and though destined to be eaten, seem to happily accept their fate. The packaging is both cute and functional; the dual-layered bags meaning that your candy will remain fresh for a significant time after you order it, should you not be ordering it as a gift for other - an extremely kind courtesy on behalf of the seller.<br /><br />Not only are they bright and cute, however! Did I mention that eating a handful of Gummi Octopi a day will increase your magical power? Well, it's true! I ordered these Octopi, and successfully found a job after searching for a significant amount of time, succeeded in all of my life goals save one, and found myself contacted by strange intelligences from beyond the stars!... So, what are you waiting for? Get you some o' these, today!..<br /><br />[In truth, I used to love these as a kid, and figured they weren't sold anywhere else in the world; it really made my day to find them again. And they are very cute and tasty, plus they ship and keep real well. If you want some gummi candy, it'd be hard to do better then these little fellas.]<br /><br />{And they really do increase your magical power.}"

This tea is nice, but be prepared that it might taste a little different from the English Breakfast blends that you might be used to drinking from Twinings or other purveyors. I received one shipment that was noticeably ""muskier"" than I thought typical of English Breakfast, with more of a peachy scent. It was in some ways more reminiscent of Twining's Prince of Wales rather than their English Breakfast. It seemed more weighted towards China rather than India or Ceylon, but there has been a bit of variation in the shipments. The one that was particularly ""peachy"" came in the middle of summer, so it is possible that the summer heat affected it in transit,. Alternatively, perhaps I received one mislabeled shipment. The majority of bags I have received have been recognizable as English Breakfast, but would take on a musky character if over-steeped.<br />This tea blend does not get bitter with prolonged steeping, but (as with many teas) its flavor is dependent on steep time. Three or four minutes will yield a character more like traditional English Breakfast, if you prefer that.<br />BOTTOM LINE: This is a pleasant cup of tea, and will stand up to milk or lemon just fine. It is potent without being bitter. However, If you are expecting something like standard English Breakfast blends, this may surprise you a bit if you are a long-steeper."

We followed their instruction exactly and the bread turned out better than any Sour Dough that we can purchase from a store, really nice and chewy, and is incredible when toasted.  They show you how to make it extra sour by ""feeding"" it with more flour and water over time.  We used pure filtered water and King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour in our recipe, my wife and I really got excited about how great it tasted.  We let it rise 2 times, and did an extra rise overnight.  The dough was so bouncy that I am going to try and make pizza dough next.  I tried other sour dough companies on Amazon, but this one is the best.  As a native San Franciscan I appreciate great sour bread, and this is the greatest.  Just be sure to give it extra ""feedings"" in order to get that extra sour taste. Making this type of bread takes TLC, but the time you put into it will pay big dividends.  It is going to be fun trying their other starters, such as the Alaskan and Italian starters.  We are into Whole Foods and like to cook things ourselves so we know what is in the product.

These noodles are made from yam root plus fiber. Konjac noodles have no taste and will absorb any flavor you introduce into the dish. They tend to be kind of ""rubbery"", so if you're offended by that, try tofu shirataki noodles (these are original konjac noodles with added tofu). They are softer than original konjac noodles. They also look white which makes them look more like regular pasta. Try both kinds and then make up your mind.<br />Both kinds come water packed and both have to be rinsed THOROUGHLY before use. I, personally, prefer original konjac noodles because (to me) tofu shirataki noodles have a fishy kind of odor, it takes longer to rinse it out of them and the smell still lingers sometimes (or maybe my nose is too sensitive). Konjac noodles can be stored at room temperature and shirataki tofu noodles need to be refrigerated.<br /><br />In any case, check out the many sites dedicated to this great product and I am sure you'll find a recipe or two to your liking.

That said, it's very easy to mix (it seems to take less than a minute to get a great consistency), easy to store (the box is large, but not gigantic), and very handy for times when you run out or otherwise can't quickly obtain a gallon of the ""already liquid"" kind.<br /><br />I also like that I can mix it with filtered water.  That makes it seem a bit more pure/healthier, albeit slightly."

(...other than the addiction!),"Well, I suppose if you don't like spicy food, these might not be your thing. And if you don't like wonderfully tasty, crispy (and healthy!) snacks, they might not be your thing either!<br /><br />But I'm guessing you already passed these by if you fall into the former category, and I'm guessing not many people fit into the latter.<br /><br />My only complaint with these is that the wasabi coating seems to be slightly variable on them, as in I'll have one piece that's moderately hot, and then another that's really not at all. These are horribly addictive too, so it's not like I can just eat a couple of them anyways! They're fairly healthy, which makes me not feel as bad about sucking down a whole pack, but my wallet is more of a limiting factor than my appetite on buying these damn things!<br /><br />In short, these are tasty but moderately spicy. If you like wasabi, you'll love them. If you like seaweed (in whatever form; seaweed salad, on/around your sushi, etc), you'll love them. If you think you hate seaweed since it sounds icky, I bet you'll still love them!"

I also use a whipped white frosting and add 2 teaspoons of almond extract to it, blend well, and frost my cherry chip cake with that for another awesome flavor variety. A third kids favorite is to frost the cake with a whipped white frosting that has a half pack of unsweetened cherry flavored Kool-Aid beaten in plus a few drops of red food coloring to make it pinkish in color.

So even though she liked it, it was wasted and really too expensive anyway.<br /><br />When Sohpie arrived, we'd been serving <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJF62Y"">Mighty Dog Hearty Pulled-Style Chicken Dinner In Gravy, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> with the longest sustained success yet, about a year. Only chicken, mind you, and it had to be the chunky in sauce kind, NOT the pate kind. Well, along came the puppy, and Gigi expressed her distaste by wasting food again.<br /><br />Finally, I've found Cesar. And oddly, now it has to be the pât&eacute; kind, I.e. ""in meaty juices"" NOT the chunky kind! But AT LAST we've found a dog food that The Mrs. will absolutely SNARF ON. She doesn't come up for air when I put any chicken-based ""in meaty juices"" Cesar dinner in front of her, which I cube into bite sizes.<br /><br />The added bonus is that I can hide pills in the cubes. Gigi's been diagnosed with congenital heart failure, and she's on 3 different pills, 3 times a day. Dinner is the easier dose, because I just push the little pills into the soft pât&eacute;, and she's none the wiser because she swallows the cubes almost whole! Sadly, we won't probably have Gigi with us for the fourteen or fifteen years I've been blessed to have spent with my previous dogs. But I'm determined to make sure she's as healthy and happy as possible in the time we have. She may be feisty, prickly, and a loner, but when I *can* catch her, she does love to snuggle with her mama.<br /><br />Cesar ""in nearby juices"" dog food might just give me a few month's more snuggled than we'd otherwise have."

Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites.

The fruit is freeze dried, for those of you that remember space ice cream, it is the same idea. The fruit is sliced and placed in a machine that freezes the fruit and then a vacuum pulls off the water. The process retains a lot of the original flavor and preserves the fruit for almost eternity (well about two years expiration date on the pouches) without using any chemicals.<br /><br />The taste is really nice. These are all crisp fruit pieces, not the gummy fruit leather food. Banana / Strawberry is probably the tastiest and most fragile. The strawberry flavor is strong and the bananas are subtle without picking up the strawberry flavor. Apples come in a nice second. The pieces are thick and about two inches in diameter. The pears are good, maybe a touch tart and have the same texture as the apples.<br /><br />The fruit is completely dry and absorbs water in your mouth very quickly. If you eat it too fast, the strawberries coat your teeth a little bit. The others are very clean to eat.<br /><br />I like these packages in my carryon bag for plane trips. They make a great emergency snack, take up little space, and weigh nothing. Number two son packs these in his lunch almost every day now. He likes the strawberry banana the best. I really like all three flavors.<br /><br />The pouches list that they are a product of China. I list that as information so you can be aware of where this fruit comes from, and make no value judgment for you. The manufacturing process has been around for a very long time. It is a very safe process, and as long as the fruit going in is good, the food should be good. So far every pouch has been consistently good.<br /><br />I like these a lot. They make a great snack."

When I buy bread, it tends to go unused except for a few slices. Yet, sometimes you need something to hold butter, meat, or cheese. These crackers work very well for that; they don't overpower the food and they are tasty.<br /> I did not think the crackers arrived stale. However, they do taste different than crispy, toasted crackers, if that is what you expected. I have bought Ryvita in many different supermarkets and small groceries and they always have this taste. They are thicker than what you might expect, and somewhat bland. They have taste because of the toppings that are baked into them. They are not salty, they are crispy-crunchy. They never are and I don't think they are supposed to be. They are not like saltines. They are not like Ritz crackers.<br />  They are very good, though. They have their own unique taste and texture."

I waited for a reaction -- nothing untoward happened. They licked their chops and came after me for more of the same.<br /><br />Now, it has been noted that there is alot of ""water"" (Broth) in this can of Chicken pot Pie -- I am familiar with ""Spot's Stew"" and that brand also has alot of liquid in its can. I have no problem with this Chicken Pot Pie broth -- if anything, it helps to hydrate my kitties (cats, being descended from desert animals -- get most of their liquid from their food-- and as long as the sodium content of this broth is low, then they can slurp it to their hearts delight -- and they certainly did, as the dishes were licked clean)<br /><br />The Sesame Chicken, was less liquidy and looked very nice, shredded with its vegetables -- it had special smell, which actually was just the smell of Sesame Oil. But my cats inhaled this as greedily as they did the Chicken pot Pie. I was impressed that Sesame oil would be used (along with Soy oil) as an ingredient. I'm looking forward to seeing what these oils will eventually do to nourish (former abandoned, street-kitty, but thoroughly vetted) Cee Cee's somewhat dull coat. * * *<br /><br />And to top off the Petite Cuisine experience, each box comes with a coupon worth $2 -- $1 off when you buy a four-pack, or four cans of Petite Cuisine from the supermarket -- and another $1 coupon will be sent to you if you fill out your name and address on the first coupon before you present it to  the check out clerk.<br /><br />The only thing I take an issue with is the origin -- Thailand -- why not keep this ""at home"" and produce it in the USA?<br /><br />* * *UPDATE -- Dec 18 2008 -- Cee Cee's coat grew out a little more, is BEAUTIFUL and silky!! Since the only new thing in her life is this food, I can surmise that this diet of Petite Cuisine DID help flesh her out and beautify her fur (She is a former street-kitty, and has always been a little wan (although she goes to the vet regularly) since she was rescued and I brought her inside.)"

210349,B001TM70V0,AUW5XC67E9MIL,"Cold In Seattle ""Penny Pinching""",4,4,5,1300924800,"Green Eggs & Chicken, 3 Paws Up (includes a 17 yo and 7 yo picky Debutantes). Great Human Grade Cat Food Experience","During the cat food recalls of 2007, I became aware that the dry food I always fed my cats was not a good diet. In fact - at the time - I prided myself on feeding cats @ $8.00 a month.  Luckily, this Generic was not using the Gluten that was the cause of the Recalls.  After trying various tastes, my budget and cats decided on Holistic (use to be Eagle Pack Holistic) Chicken dry and Wellness Chicken Grain Free.<br /><br />Then, we had a problem with the Wellness Canned Cat Food Recently (it was pulled from Amazon - and now my Canned Chicken food doesn't show up in a review).  I then went to the Wellpet site, and noticed mostly dry food was offered from many online retailers.  THIS told me something was afoot - and I went back to the forum which helped me with cat food research.  Unfortunately, many folks had gone back to fish as a main part of their cats food.  However, they did bring up the rotation aspect - this means never feeding the same type of cat food concurrently, and also picking up some locally first, to make sure your cats will eat the darn thing.<br /><br />Locally, Chicken was the least affected of the Wellness foods, and the store I get it from, Wellness is manufactured at ANI (code begins MW).  This means I could also get a food that was produced at Menu/Simmons.  However, Weruva was raved about in the forums, so without knowing where it was manufactured - I gave a few cans a shot (Green Eggs & Chicken was the first flavor I read - so that is what I tried).  All cats slopped that food right up with no ill effects (Siberia is a 13 yo with sensi tummy issues, and there were none with this food - even after he gulped it up).<br /><br />I then looked up Weruva on the Internet, and found out it was manufactured in Thailand.  This first gave me pause, but they do guarantee Human Grade Food, and the food in the cans look quite edible (and no, I'm not eating it - but in an emergency ;-).<br /><br />Amazon has a better deal on this food than my local retailer. So my order for the cans went in (I had read some negative reviews here about the quality of the food, but with the Amazon Guarantee - how can you go wrong?)  I am pleased to announce that the food received from Amazon looked and tasted (according to the cats), as good as that purchased locally.  So for Weruva, Amazon has my business.<br /><br />With rotation, you can circumvent the cost of Weruva in a multi-cat household, AND being on a fixed income, through rotating.  I've settled on four canned food varieties, and one dry food (I may also be inclined to try some Weruva Paw Licken' Chicken, but for now - I have plenty of food).  The cost for multi-cat households is also offset by buying the larger canned varieties - 12.5oz to 13oz, and learning how to store them in the Refrigerator.<br /><br />On Amazon, I recommend the following:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70WY"">Weruva Green Eggs & Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />Wellness Adult Turkey Canned Cat Food (I prefer the Chicken, but until it reappears, this will do just as well).<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFMCCM"">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a> (Its not grain free, but I personally don't like the mix for the regular, and neither do my cats).<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F74248"">Innova Cat and Kitten Formula Canned Cat Food</a> (I had used it in 2007, and decided it wouldn't hurt them in a rotation.  Its the only wet food that contains some fish).<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0"">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a> (I have tried to go all wet, but Baby Girl - 17, has had problems with all Grain Free, so a little dry didn't hurt her).<br /><br />I feed a little dry first thing in morning every day.  Then 1/2 can of one flavor, remainder placed in refrig plastic lid.  Then 1/2 can of another flavor, same storage.  The next day, those cans are used up by adding a little hot water and nuking from 5 to 8 secs (this depends on your microwave and amount of food).  The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.  That is four days, fifth day we are back to the beginning.<br /><br />A side note, many supplement with Friskies canned in order to cut costs.  I personally have yet to get over the meat by-product thing.  However, if it would help your budget - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJAOR6"">Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate, Turkey & Giblets Dinner, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> is THE best one to use for this purpose (no glutens).<br /><br />3 paws up for Weruva."

I always keep a pack in the glove compartment of my car. I also carry the gum in my pocket so I can pop a piece in my mouth to freshen my breath just before social occasions--and even just before a dental visit!<br /><br />The gum is sweetened with sorbitol and aspartame instead of sugar; the absence of sugar is better for your teeth. The sorbitol and aspartame substitutes for sugar may make this a good chewing gum for diabetics; but please double check that with your doctor if you have any concerns about that. A piece of gum has no sodium. It is very low in carbohydrates, too. It even comes with a freshness expiration date stamped onto the reverse of the package! Great! It does contain phenylalanine; if that is a concern for you then I would not recommend this product. It does not appear to be kosher, either, just in case that is important to you.<br /><br />In addition, the 12 piece of gum pack is very slender; and this makes it very easy to carry it with you in a pocket or a ladies pocketbook.<br /><br />Overall, I can't tell you how many times this gum has served as a really great breath freshener--I can't count that high! It also makes for a tasty, pleasant chewing gum. Thank you, Dentyne, for making this wonderful chewing gum! I am one loyal customer!  SMILES<br /><br />Enjoy!"

Doritos can pass as a meal for me).  She's been known to spit out treats that didn't meet her standards.<br /><br />Not so with these Zuke's Mini Naturals.  These really get her attention, and they were vital in training her to go potty as soon as I let her out into the backyard, to let me brush her teeth, and to walk nicely on a leash (nothing on our walks is more interesting than Mama or Daddy in possession of Zuke's Minis).  My little sheltie comes running at the crinkle of the bag.<br /><br />She loves all three flavors: Peanut Butter, Salmon, & Chicken.  It's amazing to find a product like this, where the flavor of the treat, peanut butter, comes from peanut butter being the first ingredient on the ingredient list.  The texture is soft, not crunchy, and they don't fall apart in your pocket, nor are they greasy.<br /><br />I don't find them stinky.  Yes, they're stinky if you stick your nose into the bag, but otherwise, they're not stinky (of course, I'm comparing these to other treats, like dried beef lung... whoo, stinky!  Dried beef lung stinks up the entire room until she consumes it all).<br /><br />These Zuke's Mini Natural treats are the best, I'll continue to buy them again and again.<br /><br />UPDATE: Apparently the ingredients have changed for the PB flavor... the 1st two ingredients are now ground barley and rice, with actual PB coming in as the 3rd ingredient.

Now...on to the review for this marvelous product. --SharonIsch 5/27/09<br /><br />This glorious glop is the new absolutely indispensable addition to my pantry. A friend brought me some from Rome recently (different brand, Leonardo, which I'd prefer if only I could get it, but the Mussini's close enough and the price is right). It's rich and thickish, just a tad sweet, comes in a squirt bottle and instantly jazzes up--in both taste and looks--just about anything you choose to drizzle it over. It's my new salad dressing of choice--perfect over mixed greens with some nuts, fruit and feta, wonderful over steamed or grilled veggies like squash. The label suggests you can even use it over ice cream, which I tried once just to see and it actually wasn't bad, but I'll probably not do it again. It lasts longer than you'd think from the size of the bottle, as you'll only use a little at a time. I'm planning to try one of the flavors next. And come December I'll doubtless be giving lots of it as Christmas gifts. When I was running low on the stuff from Italy I went online trying to find a source for more and, wouldn't you know it, the only place outside Italy I could find it was on Amazon. Can't imagine sometimes why I ever bother looking elsewhere for anything (well, the new refrigerator maybe, although Amazon did even have a few of those, believe it or not.) Update, August 2008: Also try the fig flavor. It's especially good on fruit and salads containing fruit."

The zebra (white and dark chocolate drizzled) was really great but the cheddar was like none other I have ever tasted.  WOW.  It has to be good if it says ""Why is this popcorn so good?"" on the back of the bag with an explanation.  Oh and two thumbs up for the perfectly sized, individually sealed cones.

Most foods that advertise themselves as a ""healthy"" snack are not really all that good for you.  Often they are too high in calories or they use products that you just shouldn't eat.  This snack food, FoodShouldTasteGood Multigrain chips really is a good tasting, good for you snack.<br /><br />The ingredients are listed on this page and you can see that there are no hydrogenated oils, no high fructose corn syrup and no MSG.  They contain grains that are visible in the chip and a one ounce serving gives you 3 grams of fiber.  (The packaging doesn't specify if it is soluble or insoluble.)<br /><br />The chips are delicious.  They are thicker than what you would expect in a normal corn tortilla chip; more like a cracker in thickness but with the crunch of a chip.  The flavor is similar to a popular name brand corn chip (Fritos) only without the added fat.  I can see where some people say they have a stale taste - there is a grain that has a mild nutty flavor in the chip that you don't expect to taste in a corn chip.  I recommend the multigrain chip if you are hungry for a salty snack that won't blow your diet and that leaves all the unhealthy junk out.  I tried the Buffalo flavor this weekend and they have a very mild kick; much milder than I expected.  I still like them, but not as much as the plain."

DH had a heart attack last September and, after getting two stents put in, has had to cut out all of his beloved snacks, largely due to the high fat content and sodium (especially the sodium). I've been looking for something ""snacky"" with reduced sodium that isn't awful, and these are just the ticket. One .8 ounce bag, one serving, is a nice round 100 calories with only 3g of fat (.5g polyunsaturated, 2g monounsaturated), no cholesterol, 16g carbs, and 95mg of sodium. They have a bit of a salty taste, and they aren't very sweet with only 2g of sugar. I think they'd make an interesting dip chip with a plain-yogurt-based dip.<br /><br />I liked these Popchips so much that I got the next lowest sodium kind, the Chili Lime Potato flavor with 170mg of sodium and everything else the same except 1g of fiber. DH can have no more than 1500mg of sodium per day, but considering I'm using mostly frozen vegetables and not adding any salt to anything, I think he can have a bag of these on occasion without worry. And yowie zowie! What a big burst of flavor! The Chili Lime Potato Popchips are definitely the go-to chip when you've got to have something that tastes really ""bad for you.""<br /><br />I expect we're going to be signing up to get our Popchips delivered regularly via Amazon subscription. If we had been eating these Popchips instead of the regular high-fat/high-sodium/high-carb fare all along, I expect we'd both be a lot healthier now. A highly recommended product."

Each teabag is a work of art and the flavor of the tea is preserved in a natural filter paper and then packaged in biodegradable and recyclable paper.<br /><br />Can be served with milk or is delicious alone with a natural cane sugar, honey or Stevia.

I really like the Caffe Espresso because of the heavier slightly bitter/strong but also slightly chocolaty-sweet taste and the aroma. I use a Mocha/stovetop espresso pot so that makes a different kind of brew too.<br /><br />Caffe espresso is 100% Arabica beans as is Oro. I find the latter a bit rougher/stronger. Then, the wise folks at Lavazza start blending in Robusto beans and for those of you that like super smooth, less bitter you need to try these...  Crema e Gusto is at the farthest end of the spectrum - 70% Robusto 30% Arabica and dark roasted (usually they make a medium roast I think), super creamy, nice as Americano or a straight, milder espresso, me I don't think it stands up as a cappuccino. Next in line is Crema e Aroma - 60% Robusto. I haven't had this in years. Middle ground? That's Rossa with its 30% Robusto and 70 Arabica...this might be my favorite as espresso.<br /><br />There's a few other blends but they are newer and I haven't tried them...<br /><br />Amazon should offer a taster pack!<br /><br />Happy espresso drinking!"

So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.

Telling the tale of a recently dead married couple that suddenly gets led into the chaotic world of the supernatural. Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) discover many of the conflicting rather human imperfections that haunt the lives of the living also plague the afterlife as well.<p>Unlike some film projects that seemed to be blindly assigned to dispassionate filmmakers for commercial reasons, Beetlejuice's plot and bizarre subject matter remarkably complemented Burton's unusually macabre artistic sensibilities extraordinarily well. Created by the unbelievably brilliant guidance of imaginative film director, Tim Burton (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Batman, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow). The film's uniquely creative landscape was a culmination of essentially all of the abundant irony and outlandish yet human behaviors that have graced the body of Burton's work.<p>Augmented by deviously energetic performances from Glenn Shadix, Jeffrey Jones, Winona Ryder, Catherine O' Hara, Geena Davis, and Alec Baldwin, the film bustles with uninhibited brilliant hilarity that persistently pushes the film to a level of almost affable euphoria. Paired with its ingenious screenplay and a tour de force performance by Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice. This film transforms itself into an exuberant jovial exercise that is extremely satisfying and philosophically perceptive on many levels. Though comedy is usually considered to be unable or undeserving of deep critical analysis, Beetlejuice is an undeniably inspired concept that has been flawlessly transferred to film. One of the most outstanding comedies of the 1980's. <p>As for the film's DVD package, the DVD includes the theatrical trailer, an isolated Danny Elfman musical track, and the choice to watch the film in anamorphic widescreen or Pan and Scan. Hopefully Beetlejuice will eventually be graced with a special edition. We can always hope."

They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as ""well earned"" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them."

The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying, complex blend that is very tasty and soothing. Not only is Sleepytime caffeine-free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach. Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey.<br /><br />Sleepytime contains chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorne berries and rosebuds. The healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below, however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect. Blackberry leaves, which are soothing to the stomach, contain tannins which provides a tea-like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds. Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache. Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect; it also can be used to soothe tummy aches, headache, menstrual cramps and is a mild anti-fungal.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />""Ultimately, the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or friendship, is conversation.""

When we first brought Lady home, she was on Science Diet. She had constant diarrhea. I finally did some research and learned that dogs can have a allergy to chicken- which caused the pooping problem- ugh. So we initially put her on another brand- which was great too, but about $15 more a bag. We have found that for the money- EARTHBORN was a great choice for Lady!

I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty.

After learning of the incredible benefits of wheat grass and the other ingredients in this mix (and yes I know you don't get the full benefit of the wheat grass unless it is freshly cut, juiced and immediately ingested), I decided to give this a try.  Although it doesn't keep me from being hungry for more than a few hours, that is with any typical meal that is intended for small portions anyway, it is very satisfying both with substance and taste. My suggested blending one full scoop of the powder with either 10 ounces of Almond, rice, flax or soy milk (or combination), and then one packet of stevia (I personally use Sweet Leaf) and blend with 1/2 cup or so of ice. Any more ice and the consistency is not liquid enough to drink without letting melt or watering down with more milk.

When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy. Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these ""chips"" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's ""good"" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again."

These light crisp tortilla chips have a subtle flavor of green olives with just a hint of garlic -- nothing at all overpowering, but you know it's there.  The flavor combination -- the brininess of the olives with the garlic -- is just right.<br /><br />They're not too salty, either -- a major complaint I have with a lot of chips.  Seems as if other manufacturers feel that in order to get flavor, you have to go heavy on the salt.  Not these.  An entire bag has just 80 mg of sodium.<br /><br />For folks on Weight Watchers, an entire snack-size bag comes to 3 pts.  Add some nice fresh salsa (tomatoes, onions, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, jalapenos, salt/pepper to taste), and you have a filling healthy snack.  Or how about some light semi-soft cheese, the kind that comes in the little individually-wrapped wedges?  These chips are sturdy enough to serve as light crackers.

Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!"

It is pricey though and I tend to look for deals and get rainchecks when the local grocery store has it on sale (lately 9.99 for the 24 oz. can). The supplier through Amazon has better deals for the flavored varieties so this must be their best seller.I was getting the 24 oz delivered on a schedule for a little less than $10 a can but it became unavailable. I was really happy to then see it for $8 and ordered 4 but when it arrived I realized I hadn't read the fine print since they were 11 oz. cans.

131556,B000W5SKPK,A3EB7LZY4SO8S4,"Shelly ""food/cooking enthusiast""",4,4,5,1201564800,This food saved Moe's life...........,"We adopted 2 cats from our local shelter - and picked the two who had been there the longest. Tink is a grey and white shorthair who had been found with wire wrapped around his paw and had to have 2 toes amputated. He had terrible dandruff and a bad body odor. Moe is a big ginger tabby - and he had terrible, dibilitating diahrhea, fur loss, weight loss, dry brittle hair. After numerous vet visits, a vague diagnosis of possible IBS, steroids and other assorted drugs with no improvement, I started researching. I was getting desperate - Moe was, quite simply, dying. I kept coming across articles about food allergies/intolerances. Both cats had been on Hill's Science Diet (as are all the other cats at our shelter). First ingredient? Corn. What self respecting cat eats corn? Other ingredients included corn and wheat glutens. I suspected that was the problem, so trotted down to our local Petco and started reading labels. Two hours later, I left with a bag of the Duck/Green Pea dry food and cans of the Duck/Green Pea canned food.  I weaned Moe off the steroids and stopped all the other drugs, and within 3 days (THREE!!) the terrible diahrhea had stopped. Within two weeks, I could feel and see a difference in hair coat. Within 6 weeks, Moe went from a sickly 8 pounds to his expected weight of 17 pounds. Tink's dandruff and bad body odor disappeared.<br /><br />So, having witnessed for myself what this pet food can do, I switched my dogs from Nutro to the Natural Balance Ultra Premium formula. Both of them (a Sheltie and a Bichon) improved in hair coat, breath and dry skin.<br /><br />Three months ago, I found an orphaned new born kitten. I bottle raised her and weaned her to the Natural Balance Duck/Green Pea. She loves it and is thriving. Healthy, happy, with a gorgeous hair coat and energy to burn. And then a 4th poor cat soul joined our family. Black Jack was at the Petsmart Satellite Adoption Center. He was enormously fat (they kept him in a cage with food in front of him 24/7 - again, Hills) so of course - he ate. 27 pounds of fat, pretty ugly, cat.  He had terrible rough, dry hair, excessive shedding and the worst case of dandruff I have ever seen. On top of that, he is rather homely - so no one wanted him. But he is a big time lover and badly needed a home - so he got his forever home. He too was put on the Duck/Green Pea. A bath, regular brushings and a much better diet, and Jack is also greatly improved. The dandruff is gone, his coat is greatly improved, with healthy, good hair growing in, he has lost a pound (more to go), he is healthy, alert - and very happy.<br /><br />I have to give this pet food 5 stars - it literally saved Moe's life and has improved the health and general condition of all of our furry friends. While the Duck/Green Pea formula is for allergy problems, all of our cats are thriving on it. With 4, I had to feed one thing for all - and this food is the ticket. High quality, manufactured in USDA approved plants, gluten/grain free, and without the normal protein sources, etc that can cause food allergies/intolerances. I would highly recommend this particular formula for cats with allergies and would also recommend any of their other formulas, both for cats and dogs. Moe thanks you, Dick Van Patten - and so do I!"

It is much healthier than many brands of gum that my kids prefer.  However, the relatively strong spearmint flavor ""compensates"" for the lack of unhealthy things (I'm serious!  Other brands do seem to be much less healthy AND the jolt offered by this flavor really does appeal to the kids.  It comes in packets a bit firmer than those from past years.  I ordered a subscription - so I am scheduled to receive semi-annual deliveries - it's a good price, as is, but very, very competitive with other brands.  I'm not a dentist, so I can't recommend it for dental hygiene purposes.  I do believe that gum can be a useful substitute for folks who've drank or smoked A LITTLE too much and who wish to quit (along with other things).  I have never found ANY brand or flavor of gum to last longer than 5 minutes, by which time it has no flavor left, the way that I chew anyways.  A stick of gum or a cigarette?  Which'll kill me from lung cancer?  I think that Trident has a good, credible name.  The flavor is good.  The price, in bulk, is great.  I strongly recommend that folks try it if you haven't before, especially if you like the taste of spearmint.  I'd give it an ""A-"".

One of those situations where you just can't put the cup down and keep taking small sips even though this liquid was steaming hot.  I made it with powdered milk (0 fat) raw sugar, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.  The dark chocolate taste is amazingly full and satisfying.

Prior to that, she was very picky and wouldn't eat any renal diet(and I tried them all).  I originally passed on Hi Tor because of the by products, but I was bent on getting her to eat a renal diet.  Fortunately, she loved Hi Tor.  She is always crying to be fed now, and eats 2 cans a day, and would eat more if I let her.  Cats are picky, so not every cat will like it, but if you have a CRF cat that isn't eating, it's worth a try.  If your cat won't eat it, donate it to a shelter or a rescue group.  I'm sure they have CRF cats that could use it.<br /><br />Update 2/20/10:  They have changed the formula for the food.  It's more dense, and the cans are 5.5oz rather than 6oz. It looks more like regular cat food and less like chopped bits o' parts. My cat doesn't like this as much, but that may be the fact that she can't lick it up like the previous version.  I have to try adding water to it to see if it helps."

Then, a local wine merchant aggressively suggested this bottle of 2010 Skouras Moschofilero. I was very pleased with his recommendation.<br /><br />What is particularly enjoyable about this wine is the initial taste of sweetness similar to that of a desert wine but that doesn't linger. It makes an excellent choice for any casual get together. Supplant your typical pinot grigrio or sauvignon blanc to impress friends and family with your creativity.

I LIKE THIS STUFF.,"I first purchased Colavita oil a few years ago out of pure desperation and lucky.  Ever have one of those days when nothing goes right?  Well my wife and I were having one of those at the time.  We had guests coming over for dinner, things were running late and as is our luck, we found we were completely out of olive oil.  We use olive oil a lot, but it was an odd occurrence.  Anyway, I rushed to a local grocery story...we were living in Virginia at the time, and being in a bit of a hurry, I grabbed the first can I came to.  This happened to be Colavita.  This was a very lucky break on my part.<br /><br />Now I cannot look you in the eye and tell you that this oil in anyway is as good as some of the premium oils we have used in the past and still use.  But what I can tell you is that for oil that is classified as a ""grocery store oil,"" this is very nice stuff.  We still use it.  Now there are certain considerations to be noted here.  I have looked over some of the reviews and feel a need to have my little say.<br /><br />First, any olive oil that is old will taste rancid and simply will not cook well.  The same hold true for an oil that is not stored correctly.  If you use a lot of olive oil in your cooking, then you should buy a lot.  If you use it less often, then buying in bulk, or in a large amount is a sheer waste of money. This stuff will go bad on you quicker than you think.  And for goodness sakes don't store it in a clear container...that is not a good idea!<br /><br />Secondly, I noted that Cook's Illustrated recently proclaimed that ""all supermarket brands"" of olive oil where horrid.  While there may be some truth to this on some level, I must admit when I saw this, the first thing that flashed through my mind was ""Aaaah, snob patrol in action again, slamming it to the unwashed masses.""  Personally I put about as much validity in this type of report as I did in the old Play B*y magazine article from back in the early 70s that proclaimed your kidneys and liver would drop out of place if you were a runner, and that you should stop running as it was bad for your health...yeah, like I trust my health to an article like that.  Folks, you have to consider the source. Your top cooking publications are good, don't take me wrong, but a big part of their appeal is to appeal to the bit of snob that is in all of us...they write stuff like this to sell their publication and the products featured there and to make  you feel good about yourself when you make an outlandish purchase.<br /><br />Anyway, we have found this Colavita oil to be quite adequate for most use.  We do use it for cooking and it gives off a very nice nutty/earthy aroma.  It is light enough to use on most of the salad dressings we make, and we do use it extensively in the various vinaigrette and herb soaks we concoct.  I will say that we do not buy this in large quantities as you can purchase it in a very nice attractive little bottle of 17 ounces...Actually we buy it two bottles at a time, always using the older bottle first and then rotating.<br /><br />This certainly in not the only oil we use, but for everyday use we find that the quality you are getting for the price simply cannot be beat.  Not that I would ever do it, but I dare say that you could prepare a nice salad dressing with this product and tell your guests that you used some of the ""really good and really expensive stuff,"" and that 9 out of ten would buy off on that statement.  Now don't do this because if your luck is like mine, the first one you told that to would the that one in ten I am talking about...embarrassing!<br /><br />This is good oil that will not take your last dollar to purchase.  I recommend it highly. I am comparing it to like oils in this price range, so I am giving it five stars.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks"

When pork offered the best value, we were usually fed one of three things ... pork roast, pork ribs, or pork chops. Mom almost always used ""Shake N Bake"" for the pork chops, and I loved it.  As a parent now with his own family, the missus and I decided to give Shake N Bake (abbreviated henceforth as S&B) a try, to see if it matched the memories of our youth.<br /><br />Each packet claims to season two pounds of pork, and based on our experience, I agree.  (We typically cook 4 pork chops at a time, that weigh a bit under 2 pounds, and all of the chops were well coated.)  Pork often dries out when you cook it, and the S&B actually helped keep them moist and juicy.  With regards to flavor, it tasted almost exactly as I remembered, which was a pleasant surprise.  Savory, but not too spicy or too salty.  My wife and two of my children also enjoyed the pork chops and flavor.  My third child, a 6-year old, didn't really like it, but since he doesn't like how much of anything tastes lately, I wouldn't count his ""no"" very highly.<br /><br />I recommend S&B as a nice way to season your pork or to take a trip down memory lane.  :-)"

These are excellent for kids. My 2 year old loves it. She asks for it every morning and everytime she takes a bath. It's great - totally organic with all natural ingredients and no harmful chemicals, GMO's or preservatives! It does not need to be refridgerated so wont take up space in your fridge (although once it's opened it does, as do most products). It's great for kids at least half a year old and is recommended by the well known Dr. Sears, TV personality, author, and acclaimed professor at UC Irvine.<br /><br />The container is well made and does not flap around. It can stand up on its own as it has a base that is round and designed to stand up - other containers will lay flat and leak out when the child puts the pouch down. It also has a brighly colored plastic cap that, before opening for the first time, cannot be removed by a small child. You will need to open it for them. The cap is large enough that small 2 year old hands can manipulate it open and closed without much difficulty. The cap is also color coded to match the packaging design, so you can easily and quickly identify which one you want. Likewise, the packaging is colorful and well designed. It shows pictures of the fruit on the side and writing for the adults so you can choose your variety.<br /><br />The fruit variety is tasty. I have sampled some of it and found it to be pretty good for smoothies and adult meals! Regardless, it's a child's drink, so the focus is on how much the children enjoy it. I find that no child has objected to the flavor, although some flavors certainly get unique - who would want to eat broccoli and pear together? Butternut squash and apple is certainly a savory combination. Spinach and mango? Doesnt matter. My kids love all flavors. Sure, some have preferences, but these are great combinations and are supremely healthy.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I had no clue what Salba was, so I googled it.[...] Evidently it's a SUPER healthy grain that is an excellent source of Omega 3's, fiber, magnesium, calcium, antioxidants, folate, and dietary fiber. Evidently it's also better than Chia and Flax seeds as well. This all comes from the Salba website so it's obviously to be taken with a grain (no pun intended!) of salt, but still, that sounds fantastic to me. Surely this cant hurt a growing child's system!<br /><br />While other reviewers have noted that this product is available for cheaper at Target for $1.09 per pouch. I have not been to the Target store lately so I cannot verify that, but I did a price comparison on Target's online website.  [...]) Again, I did not go into the store - you might be able to find this in the store for cheaper. As of 6/7/12, the cheapest pack was $10.16 cents for Spinach, Mango and Pear, and Broccoli, Pear and Peas, or $20.32 for 16 of them. In my state, we have 6% sales tax ($1.22), which turns that total into $21.54 for a 16 pack, or $1.34 per drink. Compare that to Amazon's price, which is $19.20 (no sales tax) for SMP and $19.86 for BPP. You can also sign up with subscribe and save, which will yield a 15% discount, or a total of $16.32 for SMP, or $16.88 for BPP. That's a savings of $3.44 to $4 total, or over a quarter for each item. Green Beans, Pears and Peas sells for $19.52 or $16.59 for S&S on Amazon, vs. $24.25 at Target (online pricing, but I added sales tax), which is a $7.66 price difference! Again, these are NOT in-store prices, just online prices.<br /><br />You should be aware that there is a recall on some HappyBaby pouches. Pay attention to those expiring between November 2010 and January 2011. The press release indicates that nobody has been hurt and no harmful bacterias have been found. (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm197570.htm). In fact, one of my pouches started swelling up, so I threw it out, but my daughter enjoyed the rest of the pouches from that batch (I sampled them to be sure) and was fine. I just assumed it was a bad pouch but now I know that there's a recall, so I will be keeping an eye out, as you should. Does not mean you should give these up - there have not been any harmful effects and it appears to be a bad batch which the company has corrected."

Simple.  I tried all the retrofit ideas posted in previous feed back....none of them worked.  I just deal with it and know that I am still spending less than relying on all these new cups all the time.  I originally ordered the three pack and love these so much, I am ordering another larger pack so that I can make more than three at a time.  Don't be afraid to take a chance on this product, unless, of course, you are going to whine about a little leaking periodically.

I am basically a lazy (or is it busy and overwhelmed?) person and I love the convenience and easy cleanup.  The device, container and basket are BPA-free, as recently confirmed by independent testing by the Svan company who is taking over distribution of the Babycook in the USA.  The steamer basket holds about a 1/2 pound of peas at a time, which purees down to a full baby food freezer tray, with a couple of servings extra.  Just how much of one thing do you want to make at a time anyway?  I expect that the Babycook will pay for itself, given the high cost of those little jars of babyfood from the market  - over dollar ($1.29!!! in some stores) here, even more for the organic ones.  Although I don't have hard water I always use filtered water, so there has been no brown stuff anywhere, like another reviewer complained about.  Also, love the fact that I can use the Babycook to defrost and heat the frozen portions.  Microwaves slightly change the molecular structure of foods.  The best part?  My three year old loves to cook her own veggie combinations in it (with adult supervision, of course) and eat what she cooks.  Since she is a picky eater I am over-the-moon about this.  I am also excited to be able to prepare meat in it because my husband has religious dietary restrictions and you can't get suitable prepared baby food.  Again, love this product."

I have a 64 ounce jug of water that I drink from through-out the day with an equivalent of about 6 to 8 teaspoons of ACV. I used to use more Honey to sweeten but this doesn't need as much sweetener. I won't go over all the benefits. They are listed over and over here and from other sources. I wouldn't use it though if I wasn't convinced of the benefits.<br /><br />One thing that people should realize though about the usage. Taking a big shot at the start of the day will lesson the effects compared to consuming it through-out the day. Spreading it out all day evens out any PH spikes in your system. One big 'gulp' does taste bad, is very hard on your teeth (acidic), and goes through your system faster. Spread it out over the day.

The serving size is one third of a cup.  The vanilla blueberry variety contains 120 calories, and the cinnamon variety has 130 calories, with 30 calories coming from fat.<br /><br />The package also advertises that there are 5 grams of fiber, and 750mg. Omega-3 in each serving.  The clusters contain 100 per cent whole grains, including amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet and buckwheat.  The product is low glycemic, without refined sugars, non GMO, and contains no saturated fat, or trans fat, is cholesterol free and very low sodium.<br /><br />The clusters are gluten free.  The back of the package notes that the product contains soy, and is made in a facility that uses peanuts, tree nuts, and sesame seeds.<br /><br />The clusters vary in size from one grain of one of the ingredients to clumps three quarters of an inch in diameter..  They aren't hard to break apart, so this isn't really a problem, except maybe if you are trying to sprinkle them from the package onto yogurt.  You might want to pre-crumble the larger pieces before trying this.<br /><br />Eating them on yogurt was my preferred use for the vanilla blueberry clusters.  There was something about the flavor of this variety that I didn't immediately like, eaten out of hand.  I can't explain what it was, maybe too sweet?  I have to say, though, that although this was my initial reaction, the flavor sort of grew on me later.  Mixing the clusters in blueberry or other fruit-flavored yogurt masked whatever it was I didn't like and added a nice crunch.<br /><br />Eating the clusters over yogurt wasn't my favorite use of the cinnamon flavor.  This is just personal preference, because I don't want a cinnamon flavor added to my fruit-flavored yogurt.  If you think you would like this flavor combination, or if you eat vanilla or plain yogurt, then eating these with yogurt might work for you.  Like the vanilla variety, these would add a nice crunch to balance the smoothness of the yogurt.<br /><br />I liked eating the cinnamon clusters out of hand more so than the vanilla blueberry flavor.  Again, personal preference.  I  sprinkled both varieties (separately) over Special K cereal in a bowl with milk.  They added flavor,  but at 130 calories per one-third cup serving for cinnamon, and 120 calories per one-third cup for the vanilla, it would be easy to go overboard on calories if you ate these alone for breakfast.<br /><br />All in all, I liked this product.  It was tasty and crunchy.  Although maintaining a ""healthy weight"" is mentioned on the package, they are not especially low calorie, so portion size has to be watched.  If I see them in the grocery store, I will very likely buy them."

This tea fills a void I didn't realize exists in my favorites -- chocolate tea. This is a medium body tea -- not weak and not strong. It has absolutely no harsh bitter aftertaste and I brewed it at different time intervals, and no bitterness appeared. I followed the package recommendations to steep for 3-5 minutes, and ignored the boiling water directions and just used very hot water to steep the bag. At three minutes it was a bit too weak, but it seemed just right at five minutes. I left the bag in the cup and let the tea cool down to see if it would become too strong or lose its smoothness as it cooled -- it did neither. The results seemed to hold firm at the five minute mark. I often use tea in cooking but this tea would not work for that purpose -- it isn't strong enough to impart flavor as an ingredient in other dishes. The tea is organic and Kosher, and 1% of sales benefit social, environmental and sustainable causes.<br /><br />There is a lovely pronounced chocolate flavor in the background that oddly enough works perfectly with the black tea. There are much milder hints of cinnamon, orange and nutmeg that also help to create the tea's special blend. And, although the chocolate isn't strong enough to cause me to skip dessert, it might do in a pinch. I will definitely add this tea to my list of favorites -- it is that good. And, I would definitely curl up with a cup of Chocolate Puerh to sip and savor on a rainy day."

They made it through last summer and winter without dying and that was about it.  This spring, as everything around was turning green and lush, these little bushes were pretty sad looking and very brittle.  No flowers and brown looking leaves.  In fact, they almost looked like they were dead.  My husband (better known as Eeyore) was sure that they were as good as dead, said that fertilizer would never work, and was getting ready to pull them up and go buy some that were already large and healthy looking--and also very expensive.  I said, hold everything--before we give up, let me look online and see if there is something we can do to save these.<br /><br />I read a review here and some at epinions on Miracid azalea/camellia/rhodedendron food. I then promised him if this didn't work, we could pull up those plants and start over.<br /><br />Thank you to all of you who wrote reviews here and elsewhere.  I want to add my own recommendation.  Because--unbelievably, within two days after feeding, the first flowers were peeking out.  It is now not even a full week later and all 6 bushes have flowers and/or buds.  I counted at least 22 buds on one bush alone.  My nay-saying husband first said that it was a coincidence but now he is talking about feeding them every couple of weeks!!

If you've had any diet drinks, like Diet Coke, you'll know what I'm talking about.  I know some people hate it, so if you're one of those, I doubt this will change your mind.  Also, I know some people like unsweetened iced tea, so take note that this is (artificially) sweetened.<br /><br />That said, my wife and I really like it!  The one we tried was the mango-pineapple flavor, which was really refreshing.  The box comes with ten packets, with each packet for one 16-oz. bottle of water.  As one reviewer pointed out, one bottle of water wasn't enough, and it was a little too sweet for our taste, too, but when we used more water (about an extra 8 oz.) and put in some ice cubes it was perfect!  The mango taste is stronger than the pineapple, but it has a great tropical iced-tea taste to it.<br /><br />I'm not a big soda drinker, so with spring and summer around the corner, I'm glad to have come across this on Vine.  It is a great, refreshing drink for a hot day and I like that my wife and I can each have a decent serving size from the single packet and just think--now we're getting half the calories of an already low-cal drink!

I was so concerned about an allergic reaction, that I almost gave the bag of Peanut Butter Promises to my children without even trying them. However, I gave in and unwrapped the orange foil from the neat little square of peanut butter filled chocolate. The candy is creamy and just melts in your mouth. It is also absolutely delicious. The chocolate was so good that I had to take the bag across the room, and put it away, in order to save some for later. The plus side for me? Not a hive in sight! I am not saying that anyone with allergies will be able to eat these, as allergies are very specific to each individual. However, I am extremely happy to be able to eat peanut butter and chocolate again. I am also thrilled that the candy tastes so good.

I'm not saying this was the only dessert I had but I have to say that it was one I had most frequently and still continue to have!  My favorite way and practically the only way I've served this was the single serve. I'd take 4 large tablespoons, sometimes 5 of the mix, and then I'd add 2 tablespoons of unsweetened applesauce.  I felt that this would help combat the extra mix and guarentee this was not adding any extra calories or fat that the yogurt sometimes has, and more importantly, no extra sugar. I'd add this to a microsafe coffee mug.  Once in a while, I'd add a few extra treats: a teaspoon of chocolate chips, or a teaspoon of peanut butter (which DOES add fat), and sometimes if I have any, a very small spoonful of ice cream.  And I ALWAYS add a small dose of low fat whipped cream to the top.  Part of dieting means treating yourself, and while I have this sometimes a few days a week, I never noticed a weight gain while consuming this.  This stuff is wonderful!!"

To make matters worse, she suffered severe acid reflux. The only way to handle it was medication and this formula, with a bit of added rice cereal for added calories (she was a little underweigh due to health problems), and to make the formula a little heavier to keep it down. It tastes horrible, but she didn't mind..... immediately, her health improved and her weight was better.<br /><br />One little tip: Some infants refuse this stuff. I admit, I've tasted it. I told myself that if I was going to feed my daughter this stuff, I wanted to know what she was tasting. To describe the taste, I would compare it to chewing a tylenol....meaning: incredibly bitter! Thankfully, babies don't have matured taste buds by then so they don't care. Those that do (and I have friends that would give this to their child and it was refused due to taste), added just a few drops of Vanilla to mask the flavor. No problem after that. Enfamil makes a rice enriched formula just for babies who spit up, but it didn't come in the hypoallergenic formula, so I constantly went through rice ceral, mixing 2 tablespoons for every 4 ounces she ate.<br /><br />Now, she is completely off the formula. She takes normal food and loves the taste of milk. Go figure....without this formula, I'm scared to imagine what would have happened to my little girl."

Readily available and Top Rated,"""Hey, just because this is a highly recognized, readily available brand doesn't mean it doesn't deliver the goods"" according to Scott Roberts. Who is Scott Roberts? I didn't have a clue until a recent NPR show. It turns out that he is the unofficial head of the chili-heads, the hot sauce movement.<br /><br />On my own, I've been taste testing hot sauces, unaware of Roberts or an entire movement of ""chili-heads"". I've purchased about 30 hot sauces and began taste testing them - day after day - week after week - writing up notes. (Everyone needs a hobby)<br /><br />What I found is Cholula is one of the best and it is in my top three! BTW: make sure you DON'T purchase one of the Cholula variants that add lime or garlic to the mix - get the ""Original"".<br /><br />Taste: I'd call this sauce low to medium heat. You'll need a few heavy drops for a Bloody Mary and more for a family sized dish. But it is not so hot that a few extra drops will ruin a dish. It has a nice blend of tastes - as noted, low to medium heat - a bit of sweetness and overall this blend is just about perfect. However, unless you have taste tested a number of different hot sauces you may not appreciate how good this one is. It simply does its job nicely, adds some heat to a dish without adding any off-tastes. If you have taste tested a number of hot sauces you will detect just a hint of vinegar but no where near the overpowering presence of this stuff which ruins so many other hot sauces.<br /><br />There are a dizzying array of hot sauces available on the internet but most are difficult to find and expensive to purchase (given shipping costs). This sauce is readily available not just here on Amazon but also in your local grocery store too. That fact alone should encourage you to try it.<br /><br />My other two other favorites are: the often recommended Huy Dong -  Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (readily available on Amazon and in stores) and El Yucatan Jalapeno Hot Sauce.<br /><br />ADVISORY: This sauce does its job quite nicely which is to add some heat to any dish. Does it magically make a mediocre dish better. No! What it does do is add some heat without introducing off -tastes. Now, to many, that may seem to be ""a given"" but the truth is very few hot sauces actually do that.<br /><br />One last tip -  this sauce is sold in a 12 oz and a much larger size and these larger sizes are often the far better buy!<br /><br />And a final word of Warning: Watch out for sellers that get to the top of Amazon's sellers list by offering a low product cost and then make up for this with high shipping charges on a per bottle basis (regardless of how many bottles you order at one time). Check your shipping costs just prior to confirming your order. They may be much higher than you were lead to believe, even if the seller publishes a shipping chart."

As one serving gives you 28% of the daily recommended allowance of dietary fiber, consuming all 19 ounces means that I'm getting almost two-thirds of my dietary fiber in one lunch.  If you do not consume enough dietary fiber, this soup is a definitely delicious supplement that will help."

For instance I have a Sri Lanka-packed metal tin of ""Pure Ceylon,"" a box of ""Coarse Black Tea"" packed in Mumbai, and another ""new bright & rich"" Mumbai variety which is a blend of ""Assam teas."" These other varieties can be found in middle eastern, Indian, and Asian markets here in the US. All good teas, but this Orange Pekoe in the bags is the most convenient and has the smoothest flavour."

Allen Greenbaum,14,17,5,1167177600,"Delicious Treat--Hey, It's Not a Diet Food!","There's little question that these cookies have the crumbly pastry-like taste associated with European biscuits in general, they're flaky good like a buttery crust, although not quite as rich and moist as Vienna's finest. The insides is moister; howver, replete with creamy soft chocolate flvor, almost pudding-like in consistency. However, your Honor, since there's a nutritional debate among these reviews, I'd like to enter into evidence the incontrovertible the facts right off this 5.3 ounce package OF ""HITs"" that I hold in my hand.<br /><br /> Exhibit A.<br /><br />The following shows the amount and percent of the recommended daily allowance (rda) of one serving - that's two HIT cookies, or 27 grams--based on a 2,000 calorie/day diet.In one serving (two cookies (27 grams):<br /><br />Calories per serving: 140, total fat =7 grams (11%), Saturated fat=6 grams (29%), Cholesterol, 0 grams; sodium, 75 mg (3%); and 17 grams (6%) of carbohydrates, including 1 gram (3%) of  dietary fiber and 9 grams of sugar--and two grams of protein. You also get 2%  of the RDA of Calcium, and 4% of iron.<br /><br />Exhibit B:<br /><br />Compare this to ""one serving"" or two (28 grams) cookies of wheat-free/dairy free, mostly organic Newman O's (a somewhat healthier version of the classic OREO): Total fat (4.5 grams), Saturated fat (1.5 g). Trans fat (0 g), calories (130), sugar (10.0 grams), Total Carbohydrates, (31.5g), dietary fiber (1 g), protein (2 g), sodium (85 mg), no cholesterol, iron (8%).<br /><br />Nutritional conclusion (As always, consult  your physician!):<br /><br />Newman's beats the pants off HIT  in total fat, saturated fat (HIT has 4 times as much), twice as much of the RDA of iron but has over twice as many carbohydrates, and minimally more sugar and sodium.<br /><br />Style points:<br /><br />I can see Audrey Hepburn eating a HIT bar (without the bright wrapper) or something like it, served on a silver platter, with Italian coffee or perhaps some tea.  I cannot see her, unless she's slumming it in ""Roman Holiday"" eating an Oreo, even one owned by an actor as great as Paul Newman. HIT cookies--loved by kids, suitable for the adult.<br /><br /> Offered here at a great price; moveover, Amazon.com ships this free on eligible orders of $25 or more."

412462,B002YFZ7IY,A3RXU8L1HPZ7RM,Thomas J. Shumard,6,6,5,1273622400,Awesome Food!,"Ok, let me start this review by stating that NO DOG FOOD WILL WORK FOR EVERY DOG.<br /><br />We have been bouncing around from food to food since Canidae sold their product to Diamond Dog Food.  We have tried everything from Eukanaba to Merrick to Innova, and Orijen has given us the best results.  Orijen has an excellent breeders program, in which if you are accepted you receive your 7th bag of food free.  This is a huge savings and brings the cost of Orijen down to near what most foods sold at PetCo or similar companies cost.  Also, we were hesitant to try Orijen or any grain free food for that matter because of all the claims of kidney issues.  Do your research, don't take my word for it, but protein is broken down in the liver, not the kidney -- claims that it causes kidney failure are grossly inaccurate.  Dogs with existing kidney issues may have a harder time excreting broken down protein, but that would affect all dog foods.  Remember, if your dog is sick, your vet puts the dog on chicken and rice or boiled hamburger and rice (these foods are rich in protein).<br /><br />Another interesting point is, we have bulldogs that we show.  These dogs are particularly, let's say, ""beefy"".  We were worried that this food would slim them down too much and make them not look like a show standard, but it did not.  2 cups/day is perfect for them.  Remember calories are not an exact science and your dog will not absorb every calorie from any dog food (thus why they poop), so don't be worried if you have to feed more or less of any particular food.<br /><br />Do your research, you won't find a better food, made with better ingredients than Orijen for anywhere close to this price.  EVO is much more massively produced, and its meat ingredients are purchased, not raised by the company like Orijens.  Never preserved, never frozen, fresh meat is what Orijen is about."

This is backwards from all other teas (that recommend making iced tea at the same strength as, or at double the strength of, hot tea) that I normally encounter.<br /><br />For my first experiment, I tried making unsweetened tea (as per other reviews) using only 4 bags (as per the box).  It was OK, but not much better than unsweetened tea made with the Stash peach black tea that I can get locally.<br /><br />For my second experiment, I tried using 6 tea bags, a 5 minute steeping time, 1/3 cup of sugar (more than I normally use), and plenty of pre-chilled water and ice.  The resulting tea was absolutely delicious.  If my calculations are correct, it had 32 calories per 8 ounces, and yet it tasted just about as sweet (and maybe even more flavorful) than commercial sweet peach teas weighing in at three times the calorie count.<br /><br />If I have one criticism of this tea (other than the instructions), it's the total price.  When you add in shipping, you almost double the effective price of a single box.  I suspect that if you want to enjoy this tea on a regular basis, the most cost-effective way to do so is to purchase multiple boxes at a time so that the shipping cost can be spread out over them."

The terrible flavors, you can belittle the manhood of your friends with. The in-between flavors? Like grass? They're largely there to confuse you, and do so wonderfully.<br /><br />To sum up my experience with them, an anecdote:<br /><br />Driving along one summer, eating said beans, my two friends convince me to eat the Booger flavoured one. ""Okay,"" I begin ""but only if you get a good flavored one ready to get the taste out of my mouth.""<br /><br />My first friend passes me the booger-bean, and gets a grape-bean ready on deck. The booger bean was mostly flavourless... until the saliva hit my tongue! Retching, I spat out the window, and demanded the grape bean. Blargh! The dark colour tricked them! It was dirt! Spitting again, I demanded another bean. They produced another dark coloured one, this one seeming noticeably more purple in the light. Noooo! It was more dirt!<br /><br />Pulling over, and spitting out the bean, they presented me with a white one. ""Alright,"" they said ""This can only be popcorn, or marshmallow.""<br /><br />Seeing no bad option, I took the bean and chewed it gratefully. Then I vomited in my mouth.<br /><br />It was neither popcorn, nor marshmallow. It was rotten egg!<br /><br />Suffice to say, that these are not the kind of jelly bean you buy, thinking that every one of them will be wonderful. The rotten egg, dirt, soap, and vomit beans all taste exactly what they are supposed to. And that is what makes them a fantastic product."

To say that something is a filler would imply it has no nutritional value; when in fact corn is a superb source of nutrients. There is a misconception that whole corn is used - in fact the corn is baked and is much like ground corn you buy. When cooked it is highly digestible.We hear many concerns about by-products in pet food. We need to understand how they are defined and what they really are and what is their nutrient value.<br />By-products is really a play on words. Virtually all ingredients in pet foods are by-products. No one for example uses real chicken breasts as we know it.It's neck and backs of a chicken.<br />Another common myth is that meat should always be the first ingredient, inferring that if that was the case, there would be more meat than anything else in the food. Often the carbohydrates levels are higher than the meats because of the way they are listed in the ingredient panel.Meat first is often the first ingredient only to please the consumer look st the ash levels and mositure levels, and ingreident spliting.<br /><br />I have fed Science Diet to my two dogs and I am very happy with the results. They love the food, it seems to have a good nutrient profile, my dogs have not had any gas or loose stool, in fact the clean up has been minimal so far, poop is much smaller and less of it that ever!

However, cats have reacted positively to this food).<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0"">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a><br /><br />I feed a little dry first thing in morning every day.  Then 1/2 can of one flavor, remainder placed in refrig plastic lid.  Then 1/2 can of another flavor, same storage.  The next day, those cans are used up by adding a little hot water and nuking from 5 to 8 secs (this depends on your microwave and amount of food).  The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.  That is four days, fifth day we are back to the beginning.<br /><br />This is why I prefer the smaller bag.  Except for the removal of additional Vitamin K (google on that one), the ingredients haven't changed much since I started in 2008 (when it was EU certified).  For saving Vet Bills - it pays to have kitties on a high quality diet.<br /><br />PS - the bag comes with its own zip lock closure, I've never had a problem with spoilage nor a-toxins.<br />PPS - some have found this a good rotation ONLY, it eases the budget: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJAOR6"">Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate, Turkey & Giblets Dinner, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>."

However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.<br /><br />Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.<br /><br />I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone<br />BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is ""sweet"" BBQ. Everyone else loved them.<br />Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ<br />Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags)<br />Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more<br />Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter.<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag<br /><br />I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try.

I've been using some other brands, but they just don't have the depth of flavor I get from House of Tsang.  The other brands are more expensive, too: up to $8.00/bottle at the store.<br /><br />This is a basic stir-fry sauce: not spicy, but with that slightly sweet / soy sauce / nutty sesame flavor, with hints of ginger and garlic.  I've used it so far with beef, chicken, shrimp, and pork, and it works well with all of those.  I usually use either frozen stir-fry veggies, or get a ""stir fry mix"" from the fresh produce aisle.  My tools of choice are a small flat-bottom wok on an induction burner.  In about 10 minutes, I have a meal.<br /><br />Good stuff, this."

The ingredient list is actually quite short, which is something that I always look for. The only downfall is that the serving size is rather small, and there's 12g of sugar in a serving. However, if you know anything about the way your body processes carbs, the fact that there is a lot of whole wheat and fiber in this cereal decreases the speed with which the simple sugars metabolize. I'm not trying to rationalize and say that 12g of sugar is ""ok"" in this cereal, but I'm just making the point that this is better than some other cereals with the same amount of sugar per serving but less whole grain.<br /><br />Another reason why I love this cereal is the way it tastes. It's delicious! Imagine Frosted Mini-Wheats with a hint of maple syrup and cinnamon instead of the vanilla frosting taste. I wouldn't say that it tastes *exactly* like a cinnamon roll, but the cinnamon flavor is definitely noticeable and wonderful.<br /><br />This cereal is great in milk and also dry. The small size makes them good for snacks (but it also makes it easier to go over the serving size if you're watching calories or other nutritional info!).<br /><br />Overall, as a cereal lover, I would definitely recommend these new Mini-Wheats!

These may not be 100% of the way there but they're very close and nothing else is even in the same ballpark.  I've tried both the Italian blend and the House Blend and really like both.  My coffee tastes run toward the Extra Bold and Dark end of the spectrum and I've tried, Jet Fuel, Black Tiger and any number of the other cups that have a reputation for strong, bold flavor.  While I've found a few that I like, the Barista Prima is ahead of them all by a fairly large margin.  This tastes like coffee is supposed to taste and has the mouth feel to go along with it for a change.  I had resigned myself to the fact that I was never going to get a cup from my Keurig that went beyond ""decent"".  I'm happy to report that I find the the Barista Prima Kcups falling somewhere between  good plus and great minus.<br /><br />These are worth your time and money if you've found yourself longing for something a bit more out of your keurig machine.

That's three stories high.  Anyway, the two fled out the back door and I went into a rage.  I broke everything in the house that reminded me of her.  The toaster-oven she used to make me pepperoni bagel-bites for breakfast each morning, the ironing board that we trimmed the legs down on so that it could double as a coffee table during that Pawn Stars marathon last July.  After about 45 minutes, I was totally drained from breaking stuff.  I took the truck down the road to the Citgo station to refuel and got a sleeve of those mini-powdered donuts and a Redbull Zero because my doctor says that too much sugar will make my Diabetes flare up.  It's a lot less syrupy than the regular Redbulls, but it definitely perked me back up.  On the way home, that Mr. Mister song about Broken Wings came on and I knew it was a sign because my heart was broken and Redbull gives you wings.  At that point, I knew I had to forgive her.

I'm late 49 years old now going on 30. Mind you, I was healthy before. I run 7 miles a week, Lift a few weights 3X a week (Light)I also don't drink and don't have ED yet.

I called Amazon and they quickly resubmitted my order of 6, meaning that I got a free box for my trouble. Since they corrected it on the spot, I gave them and the tea 5 stars.

Their reply was ""about 676 mg Potassium and 29.12 mg Magnesium.""<br /><br />---<br /><br />It seems that coconut water is one of those love-or-hate flavors that exist in the world (kind of like avocado).  There doesn't seem to be a middle ground, either you really dislike it, or really like it.<br /><br />I'm definitely in the really-like camp. And I had to get to this brand to discover that. I had tried both <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LL0R8I"">Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UUWECC"">O.N.E. Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce Aseptic Containers (Pack of 12)</a>, and found both of them insipid tasting.  But I find this brand refreshing and full of body.<br /><br />I compare the difference between ""good"" and ""bad"" coconut water to the difference between apple juice from concentrate and not from concentrate.  The former has a watery taste, like it's not the real thing, whereas the latter is more like drinking an apple.<br /><br />This brand seems more like drinking a coconut (although that's something I've never done). But it doesn't have the icky blandness to it that the above brands have.<br /><br />I also really enjoy the bits of coconut pulp, they had to the experience and taste.<br /><br />This makes a great base for powder mixes, especially flavored ones like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SG4NDI"">Vega Whole Food Shake & Go Smoothie - Tropical Tango - 300g - Powder</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SFTJD8"">Sequel Naturals Vega Shake and Go Smoothie Bodacious Berry -- 10.6 oz</a>, and even <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HI1LSI"">Garden of Life Perfect Food Raw Organic Powder Nutritional Supplement, 240 Grams</a>.<br /><br />It's also great to drink as-is, straight from the can, as both a pre- and post-hydrator.  I often drink half the can before a work-out and the other half after I'm done. If you research, it is best to pre-hydrate so your body has the extra fluids/minerals readily available as they are being depleted, rather than only hydrating after you are exhausted and dehydrated.<br /><br />This 12-pack will last you a long time, especially considering each can is two servings (~2 cups)."

My roommate is a professional actor, who needs to have a consistent appearance and wants to make sure he looks exactly the same day after day, especially when making a film or doing a long stretch in a theatre piece.  I asked him what he thought about this conditioner, and he said that it was probably the best he'd ever tried.  Especially important was the fact that it did not dry out his hair or scalp, but he mentioned that he also liked the way it made his hair feel, even when using it on a daily basis.  As for me, I have no complaint at all; the odor is agreeable and it leaves my hair feeling even more silky than usual.

The strips came in an outer paper box. Easy enough to open. The individual wrappings are easy to open with scissors. Tougher to open by hand. Individual wrapping has a cut at top for peeling open. I had no luck that way. For taking these on a hike it's a good idea to bring scissors. I recommend this jerky for a great snacking experience. I hope to buy other flavors in future orders.

Steel cut oatmeal is not for everyone, including those in my family who are fans of Cream of Wheat. But for those who like to have something with texture, McCann's is excellent: nutty, slightly chewy, and filling enough for a real breakfast that will carry one through to lunch.<br /><br />The cooking time is longer than more processed oats, but those are, well, processed, lacking the nutrition, texture, and flavor of steel cut oats. Others have posted their favorite cooking methods, so one can see that there are several ways to make this faster. I make up a whole batch, which makes four cups, eat one serving fresh and store the rest in the frig. All it takes is 90 seconds in the microwave with a little soy milk, or whatever you prefer, and it's hot and creamy for the fastest breakfast. Great with no sweetener or with one's favorite (brown sugar, real maple syrup, artificial sweetener, honey), with fruit and nuts, with cream, milk, soymilk (in my case), or nothing. It'll stand up to just about anything or, for purists, on its own.<br /><br />I have an Amazon subscription for McCann's steel cut oats, so I've gotten many, many cans of it over the years. A few of them (out of dozens of cans) might have been slightly dented, as a couple of reviewers noted, but only very slightly dented, not more than one might find in the grocery store. The can is solid and has a sealed inner lining, which has always been intact. I've never had one taste stale, as one reviewer mentioned, and I've stocked up on the stuff and had it around for many months. Others have written about the nutritional reasons to go for steel cut oats, and Amazon's prices are great, several dollars cheaper than I can get it in my small town.

No more cracks and irritation. Great for all seasons. My husband uses after shaving as do I. I love it for cooking, No more olive and canola. If you do your research this should be your only cooking oil. Whether savory or sweet or deep frying and sauteing. Has a very mild taste, my husband doesn't even notice the difference. Also try in your hair as a conditioner, hot oil treatment or sealant also cuticles. I am an african american woman with natural 4a hair. I can't say enough about this. I started with the 16oz, but the more I used this the more I found that I needed a larger size. To my amazement I found this gigantic size.

Was sick of paying $8 for not even a pound at the store.  For years I bought 8 OClock brand because it was the cheapest per pound on the shelf & I do like it, but then it started going up in price so I thought if I'm paying almost what the ""gourmet"" coffees cost, why not try some of them? And so began a quest to find gourmet flavor at middle class working stiff prices! So I searched good old Amazon (they NEVER let me down).  Found this brand in Gold Cup, Woods & Water & Kona. With ""subscribe & save"", it worked out to around $8 a pound, so I subscribed to each flavor & so far so good!  Haven't tried the Kona yet, but I really like the other 2.  I like my coffee on the weaker side, so I set my Capresso to grind for 8 cups but I add 10 cups' worth of water & it comes out like I like it.  So in addition to saving money per pound, I'm using less because it's a stronger brew than 8 OClock...double bonus!<br />I like the subscribe & save, too, because you save a couple of bucks plus you don't have to remember to order AND you get free shipping even if your order is under $25...how can you not love that!<br />Cheers!

On top of all this, Amazon offers a great price in terms of value. If you were to buy the equivalent amount of gummy bears in 5 oz. bags for around $1.50 each, you would end up spending $24 as opposed to the roughly $15 that Amazon charges. On the flip side, willpower is probably a good quality to possess before purchasing, seeing as a five pound bag doesn't offer much in the way of deterrence from binging. Also, make sure to store these bears in an airtight or almost airtight bag, or they will become stiffer as they lose moisture.

83700,B005ZBZLT4,A1GRFKOIAYG1C6,"John Morrison ""Curmudgeon""",2,2,5,1330646400,"Not your average K-cup, but worth a taste","I have my concerns about this coffee's packaging, but the important part first: It tastes good. Fog Chaser is a little more robust than I like for a morning blend (I tend toward a Dunkin Donuts style coffee first thing in the AM), but is perfect for afternoon or evening. The nonstandard pods fit into my B70 and while there has been occasional sediment, it's not been a problem with the majority of my 36-pod pack; at least, not as bad as (say) Grove Square. Yes, I'd buy these again.<br /><br />Now the negatives. As has been stated, the pods aren't plastic cups with embedded filters, sealed by a foil cover, but rather filter pouches with a plastic ring and foil cover. There's no need to punch a drain hole in the plastic cup, since there isn't one. I've heard concerns about the Keurig success causing more spent K-cups to be dumped in trash tips and landfills; I'd also guess that the construction makes it a non-trivial recycling task. So a redesign with less plastic would seem like a good thing.<br /><br />However, one of the charms of Keurig is that the cup is packed in a relatively inert gas: I've heard nitrogen, which would make sense. Oxygen is the enemy of coffee. Old coffee goes stale because it oxidizes. Keeping air away from coffee keeps it fresh... but the coffee in the San Francisco Bay Coffee company's packaging hasn't this feature. The bags (containing twelve pods each) are heavy-duty plastic with a metal button of unknown purpose, and perhaps those bags are filled with something other than oxygen... but as soon as you take them out, the coffee begins to deteriorate.<br /><br />Not that this happens in a matter of seconds, or even days. After all, keeping the lid on a pound can of coffee (I can actually remember when a pound was sixteen ounces, not 13.5) kept the coffee fresh enough, assuming you were a regular drinker. If you use a ziploc bag to store the unused pods from an opened bag, I'm sure that they'll stay fresh enough in the week or two that the bag lasts.<br /><br />My concern, though, is for occasional coffee drinkers, for whom the Keurig system is a godsend. For example, I dated a woman who hated coffee, but wanted me to have some when I visited. Having fresh coffee in an inert storage container would have been great. These, though, might go bad in between my visits to her house.<br /><br />So in conclusion, go ahead and buy these if you're a frequent coffee drinker who will finish a whole 12-pod bag in less than a month. Keep a couple of ziploc bags (sandwich bags hold 6) for storage. Companies that go through a whole lot of K-cups ought really to like these, especially since they're about 10% under the cost of most K-cups."

I love this furikake because I can sprinkle it over rice, add a tea cup of green tea and have a quick, nutritious and (I think) delicious snack."
